<h2 id="hdr_1">TURKISH WOMEN.</h2>

<p>On arriving in Constantinople for the first time,
one is much surprised, after all he has heard of the
thraldom of the Turkish women, to see them, everywhere
and at all hours of the day, coming and going
with apparently the same freedom as the women of
any other city in Europe. It seems as though all
these imprisoned swallows must that very day have
been given their liberty, and a new era of freedom
and independence dawned for the fair sex among the
Mussulmans. At first the impression is very odd:
one is in doubt whether all these females enveloped
in white veils and long, variously-colored mantles
are nuns or masqueraders or lunatics; and, as you
never by any chance see one of them accompanied
by a man, they seem not to belong to any one,
being all, apparently, young girls or widows or inmates
of some huge asylum for the “unhappily
married.” It is some time before you can realize
that all these Turkish men and women, who meet
and jostle one another in the streets without ever
walking along together or interchanging so much as
a nod or look, can have anything in common, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
you constantly find yourself stopping to watch them
and reflect upon this singular custom. And these
strange figures, you say to yourself&mdash;these actually
are those “subduers of hearts,” “fountains of peace,”
“little rose-leaves,” “early grapes,” “morning rays,”
“life-givers”, “sunrises”, and “shining moons”
about whom thousands of poets have written and
sung? These are the “hanums” and mysterious
slaves, reading of whom in Victor Hugo’s ballads at
the age of twenty, in a shady garden, we imagined to
be like beings of another world? These the unfortunate
beauties, hidden behind gratings, watched
over by eunuchs, separated from the world, who,
passing like shadows across the face of the earth,
emit one cry of pleasure and one of sorrow? Let
us see how much truth lies at the bottom of all this
poetry.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>First of all, then, the face of the Turkish woman
is no longer a mystery, and owing to this fact alone
much of the poetry that surrounded her has disappeared.
That jealous veil which, according to the
Koran, was to be at once the “seal of her virtue and
a safeguard against the world,” has become a mere
form. Every one knows how the <i>yashmac</i> is arranged.
There are two large white veils&mdash;one,
bound around the head like a bandage, covers the
forehead down to the eyebrows, is knotted just above
the nape of the neck, and falls over the back in two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
long ends reaching to the waist; the other covers all
the lower part of the face and is carried back and
tied in with the first in such a manner as to give the
effect of a single veil. These veils, however, which
are supposed to be of muslin and adjusted so as to
leave nothing visible but the eyes and the upper
part of the cheeks, have worn away to something
very thin and flimsy indeed, while they have drawn
farther and farther apart, until now not only most of
the face, but the ears, neck, and hair, and not infrequently
a European hat and feathers worn by “reformed
ladies,” are plainly visible. Hence the reverse
of the former order of things has come about.
Then it was the older women who were allowed to appear
with their faces somewhat less closely covered,
while the young ones were obliged to conceal them
rigorously. Now the young ones, especially if they
be handsome, show as much of their features as possible,
while the older women, in order to deceive
people, wear their veils thick and closely drawn.
And so an infinite number of charming and romantic
incidents told by poets and writers of fiction are no
longer possible, and among other fables is that of the
husband seeing his bride’s face for the first time on
the night of his marriage. Beyond the face, however,
all is still concealed, and not so much as a
passing glimpse can be had of waist or bosom or
arm: the <i>ferege</i> hides everything. This is a sort of
tunic furnished with a cape and very long sleeves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
full and shapeless, and falling like a cloak from the
shoulders to the feet. In winter it is made of cloth,
in summer of silk, all of one color, and that usually
brilliant&mdash;now bright red, now orange, now green;
but, whatever may be the change in color from year
to year, the cut is never altered. Notwithstanding
the fact that the women are enveloped in this manner,
so great is the art with which they can adjust
the <i>yashmac</i> that the pretty ones pass for beauties,
and those who are ugly look pleasing. It is difficult
to say just what it is they do with those two veils.
How artfully they dispose of their ample folds, drawing
them back and allowing them to fall in simple classic
lines or arranging them like coronets or turbans!
With what subtle grace they employ them to at once
display and conceal their charms, offering a tantalizing
suggestion, a promise, a check, and revealing
unlooked-for marvels! Some of them seem to wear
about their heads a white diaphanous cloud, which
at a breath would melt away, others to be garlanded
with lilies and jasmines: all of them apparently have
the whitest skin, and seem to borrow from those veils
a shining reflection and an appearance of delicacy
and freshness quite captivating to behold. It is a
headgear at once austere and festive, with something
of a sacerdotal or nun-like character. Beneath it,
one would think, nothing but kind thoughts and innocent,
child-like fancies could have birth. But it
appears that a little of everything is born there.</p>

<p>It is not altogether easy to define the beauty of
the Turkish women. In thinking of them, I may
say I always see a very white face, two black eyes,
a crimson mouth, and a sweet expression. But then
they almost all of them paint, whiten their skin with
almond and jasmine paste, lengthen their eyebrows
with India ink, color their eyelids, powder their
necks, draw dark circles around their eyes, and put
patches on their cheeks; but in all this they employ
taste and discretion, unlike the belles of Fez,
who use whitewash brushes to beautify themselves
with. Most of them have pretty oval contours,
noses a little arched, lips somewhat thick, round,
dimpled chins&mdash;many of them have dimples in their
cheeks as well&mdash;handsome necks, long and flexible,
and tiny little hands, generally covered&mdash;more’s the
pity!&mdash;by the sleeves of their mantles. They are
usually plump, and many of them above the medium
height. One rarely sees the dumpy or scrawny type
of our countries. One universal defect they have&mdash;their
manner of walking; they shuffle and stumble
along like big children who have grown too
fast: this, it is said, comes from a weakness of limb
resulting from the abuse of the bath, and also, in a
measure, from the wretched shoes they wear. Elegant-looking
women, whose feet must be very small indeed,
may sometimes be seen wearing men’s slippers or long,
wide, wrinkled shoes, such as a European peasant-woman
would scorn. But even that ungainly walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
has something child-like about it that, once you are
accustomed to it, appeals to you. There are none
of those stiff-looking individuals, like the figures in
fashion-plates, whom we see in our cities going along
with little mincing steps like pieces on a chess-board.
They have not yet lost the free, careless gait natural
to the Oriental, and when they do, although they
may gain in dignity, they will be less attractive.
Occasionally one sees a face of great beauty, and
not always the same type either, since there is Circassian,
Persian, and Arabian blood mingled with
the Turkish. There is the matron of thirty, whose
ample form the <i>ferajeh</i> cannot entirely conceal, very
tall, with great dark eyes, protruding lips, and delicate
nostrils, the kind of <i>hanum</i> who makes a hundred
slaves tremble at her glance, and the mere
sight of whom turns into ridicule the boast made by
Turkish gentlemen that they are four times the husband.
Then there are others, chubby little ladies
with everything round about them&mdash;face, eyes, nose,
mouth&mdash;and such a guileless, childish, kindly air of
entire and sweet resignation to their lot, which is
that of never being anything more than a plaything
and source of recreation, that you feel tempted to slip
a sugar-plum into their mouths in passing. And there
are the slender, graceful figures of sixteen-year-old
brides, vivacious and passionate, whose bright coquettish
eyes arouse a sentiment of pity in one’s
breast for the poor effendi who has undertaken the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
care of them, and the unfortunate eunuch whose
duty it is to mount guard over them.</p>

<p>The city is wonderfully adapted to form a background
and framework for the beauty of the
women and the picturesque style of their dress.
You should see, for instance, one of those graceful
figures, with its white veil and crimson <i>ferajeh</i>,
seated in a käik on the surface of the blue Bosphorus,
or extended on the grass surrounded by
the vivid green of some cemetery, or, better still,
coming toward you down one of the steep lonely
side-streets of Stambul, closed in at the end by a
great plane tree, when the wind is blowing and veil
and <i>ferajeh</i> flutter about and reveal neck and foot and
ankle. I can assure you that if the indulgent decree
of Suleiman the Magnificent were in force at such a
moment, levying a fine upon every kiss given to the
wife or daughter of another, even the avarice of a
Harpagon would receive a severe shock. And even
when the wind is high the Turkish women do not
feel called upon to struggle very hard to keep down
the <i>ferajeh</i>, their modesty not including their ankles,
and sometimes stopping quite short of them.</p>

<p>It is at first somewhat astounding to see how they
look at you, laughing too in a manner which certainly
encourages the taking of liberties. It not infrequently
happens that a young European, looking attentively
at a Turkish lady even of rank, finds his gaze smilingly
returned, sometimes by an actual laugh, or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
again, a pretty <i>hanum</i> driving by in her carriage
waves a graceful salute behind the eunuch’s back to
some good-looking Frank who has struck her fancy.
Occasionally in a cemetery or some retired street a
lively young woman goes the length of tossing a
flower as she goes by or dropping it on the ground,
with the manifest intention of having it picked up
by the young gentleman who is walking behind her.
Hence it follows that a fatuous traveller is sometimes
betrayed into making grave mistakes, and more than
one fool of a European is quite saddened at the close
of his month’s visit to Constantinople at the thought
of the hundred or so unfortunates whose peace of
mind he has destroyed for ever. No doubt there is
in some of these carryings on a frank avowal of preference,
but they are chiefly dictated by a spirit of rebellion
nursed in the heart of Turkish women and
born of their hatred of the subjection in which they
are kept. This they give vent to at every opportunity,
and these little mischievous acts of secret spite
toward their masters are more the result of childishness
than coquetry. What coquetry they have is of
a most singular kind, a good deal like the first experiments
of young girls when they begin to find
people looking at them. It consists of a great deal
of laughing, gazing up with the mouth open as
though very much astonished, pretending that they
have hurt their head or foot, certain gestures of impatience
with the <i>ferajeh</i>, which is in their way, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
various other school-girl tricks, which certainly seem
to be done more to make one laugh than with any
view of fascinating. They never pose as if for a
photograph or the drawing-room; what little art of
that kind they possess is of the most rudimentary
kind. It is plain to be seen that they have not, as,
Tommaseo would say, many veils to lift, that they
are unaccustomed to long courtships&mdash;to being “surrounded
by the pack” like Giusti’s hieroglyphical
women; and when they take a fancy to any one,
instead of wasting time in sighs and languishing
glances, they would like to say quite frankly,
“Christian, I like you.” Being unable to say the
actual words, they make their meaning clear with
equal frankness by displaying two shining rows of
pearls or laughing outright in your face. They are
just pretty tamed Tartars.</p>

    <div class="caption">Lemonade Seller.</div></div>

<p>And, after all, Turkish women are free&mdash;a discovery
which the foreigner makes as soon as he lands. It
is an exaggeration for Lady Mary Wortley Montague
to say that they have more liberty than European
women, but any one who has been to Constantinople
cannot help but laugh when he hears people talk of
their “bondage.” When a lady wishes to go out she
tells the eunuch to order her carriage, and goes
without asking any one’s permission, and stays as
long as she wants to, provided, of course, she returns
before nightfall. Formerly she was always
accompanied by a eunuch or female slave or friend.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
The bolder spirits, when they wanted no one else,
would at least take a child with them as a sort of
passport to public respect. One of them appearing
entirely alone in some retired spot would quite
probably have found herself stopped by a city
guard or a straight-laced old Turk, and subjected
to a severe cross-examination: “Where are you
going? Where have you been? Why is there no
one with you? Is it thus that you respect your
effendi? Go home at once.” But now-a-days all
this has changed, and hundreds of Turkish women
may be seen at all hours of the day quite alone in
the Mussulman streets and suburbs, and in the
Frankish cities as well. They pay each other visits
from one end of Stambul to the other, spend half
a day in the bath-houses, make excursions by water
to the Sweet Waters of Europe on Thursday, and
on Sunday to the Sweet Waters of Asia. On Friday
they visit the cemeteries of Skutari, on the
other days of the week the Isles of the Princes,
Terapia, Buyukdereh, or Kalender, to eat luncheon
in parties of eight or ten with their slaves. They
say their prayers at the tombs of the pâdishahs and
sultanas, visit the dervishes’ monasteries, and go to
see the public exhibitions of wedding-outfits. And
not a man would presume to join or follow one of
them, or even so much as to accost her. For a Turk
to be seen in some retired street in Constantinople,
not arm-in-arm or walking beside, but merely pausing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
an instant to exchange half a dozen words with
one of the “veiled,” would be considered most unseemly,
even were it written on their foreheads that
they were man and wife; or, to speak more correctly,
it would be looked upon as an audacious piece of impudence,
as though two individuals should select the
centre of one of our crowded streets in which to
make mutual declarations of love. In this sense,
then, Turkish women really have more freedom than
ours, and no one knows how highly they value it or
how eagerly they grasp at the noise and crowd and
open air and light of the streets and public resorts.
In their own houses they see but one single man,
while their windows and gardens are like those in
convents; so it is perfectly natural to find them
running about the city with all the enjoyment of
liberated prisoners. It is great fun to follow one
of them&mdash;at a safe distance&mdash;and see how she
has mastered the art of chopping the joys of vagrancy
into the smallest possible pieces. First she
will drop into the nearest mosque to say her prayers
and loiter under the arches of the courtyard for a
quarter of an hour or so, chatting with a friend;
next she will go to the bazâr, glance into half a
dozen shops, turn one or two upside down, and
finally, after purchasing some trifle, take the tramway
down to the fish-market, cross the bridge, and
examine at her leisure every wig and headdress in
every hair-dresser’s shop in the Rue de Pera; next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
we find her in a cemetery, where, after settling herself
comfortably on one of the tombs, she will sit for
some time munching sweetmeats; then back to the
city and down to the Golden Horn again, making
numberless détours to right and left, and watching
everything out of the corner of her eye&mdash;shop-windows,
signs, posters, the other ladies who pass
her, carriages, the open doors of theatres, advertisements;
then she will buy a bunch of flowers, give
a trifle to some beggar, drink a glass of lemonade
from a water-carrier, and, recrossing the Golden
Horn, in a käik this time, make some fresh excursions
about Stambul; after which she will again take
the tramway, alighting at her own door. But even
on the threshold she is fully capable of turning back
merely for the purpose of walking a little way up
the street and making the circuit of a half-dozen
houses or so before being shut in for the night, just
as some young girl who has been allowed to go out
for once alone tries to crowd a little of everything
into that one short hour of liberty. A poor fat
effendi who should undertake to follow and watch
his wife to see if she were up to any mischief would
certainly have a hard time of it: he would very
probably find himself distanced at the end of the
first half hour.</p>

<p>To really get a good view of the Mussulman fair
sex, you must go to the Sweet Waters of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
at the head of the Golden Horn, on one of the
great feast-days, or to those of Asia, near the village
of Anadoli-Hissar. These are two extensive public
gardens, watered by two little rivers, and thickly
sprinkled with trees, fountains, and cafés. There,
on a vast grassy plain, beneath the shade of walnuts,
terebinths, palm trees, and sycamores, forming
a succession of leafy pavilions, through which not so
much as a ray of sunshine can penetrate, may be
seen thousands of women seated in circular groups
surrounded by their slaves, eunuchs, and children,
lunching and passing away half a day in each
other’s company, while all around them crowds
are coming and going. On arriving you are at
once captivated by this scene, which resembles a
festival in the Islam Paradise. The myriads of
white veils and scarlet, green, yellow, and gray
<i>ferajehs</i>; the groups of slaves dressed in every hue
of the rainbow; the crowds of children in their fanciful
costumes; the great Smyrna rugs spread on the
grass; the gold and silver vessels passed from hand
to hand; the Mussulman waiters from the cafés in
gala dress running hither and thither carrying plates
of fruit and ices; the gypsies dancing; the Bulgarian
shepherds playing on their pipes; the horses
with silk and gilded trappings stamping beneath the
trees to which they are tied; the pashas and beys
and young gallants who gallop along the river’s
bank; the swaying of the distant crowd like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
movement of the wind over a bed of tulips and
hyacinths; the gayly-painted käiks and elegant carriages
which every moment deposit fresh loads of
color in that sparkling sea; and the mingled melody
of flute and pipe and tambourine, of voices
singing and children calling to one another; the
play of light and shade across the grass and thick
foliage of the trees and shrubs, with here and there
a little glimpse of some distant view,&mdash;all combine to
form an effect of light and color, sound and movement,
so perfect that one’s first impulse is to clap his hands
enthusiastically and cry, “Bravo! bravissimi!” as
though it were a masterly production on the stage.</p>

<div id="if_i_3" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

    <div class="caption">An Outing of the Women of the Harem.</div></div>

<p>Even in such a scene as this, notwithstanding the
opportunities afforded by the crowd and confusion, it
is extremely rare to find Turkish men and women
making eyes at one another or exchanging so much
as a smile or glance of intelligence. Gallantry,
<i>coram populo</i>, does not exist there as it is seen in
our countries; there are none of those melancholy
sentinels who march up and down beneath the loved
one’s windows, or those devoted followers who will
walk for three hours behind the beloved object.
Their love-making is carried on entirely within
doors. If by chance you should happen to come
upon a young Turk in the act of gazing up at a
grated window behind which may be detected the
flash of an eye or a white hand, you may take it for
almost certain that they are a pair of fiancés. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
engaged couples alone are meetings and rendezvous
permitted and all the other childish accompaniments
of authorized courtship, such as conversing together
at a distance by means of a flower or ribbon or by
the color of the dress or scarf. In this art the Turkish
women are very proficient. There are a thousand
small objects, such as flowers, fruits, grass,
feathers, stones, to each one of which some especial
meaning is attached, an epithet or verb, or even a
whole sentence, so that an entire letter may be expressed
in a single bunch of flowers, and any number
of things be said with a little box or purse full
of odds and ends apparently collected by merest
chance; and, as the signification of the various objects
is usually expressed in verse, every lover is in
a position to compose an amorous couplet, or even a
polymetrical poem, in five minutes. A few cloves,
a scrap of paper, a slice of pear, a bit of soap, a
match, an end of gold thread, a grain of cinnamon
and one of pepper, signify, “I have long loved you.
I pant, languish, die with love for you. Give me a
little hope; do not repulse me. Answer me with a
word.” And not only love-affairs, but thousands of
other matters, can be expressed with equal facility&mdash;reproof,
counsel, warning, news. Young girls just
beginning to be conscious that they have hearts find
endless occupation and amusement in committing all
this symbolic language to memory, and in composing
long letters addressed to imaginary sultans of twenty.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Then there is the language of signs or gestures, some
of which are extremely graceful, such, for example,
as that of the man who, wishing to imply that he has
been wounded by the force of his love, stabs himself
in the heart with an invisible dagger, to which the
woman responds by letting her arms fall at her sides
in such a way that the <i>ferajeh</i> opens a little in front,
which means, “I open my arms to you.” No
European, however, has probably ever witnessed the
actual interchange of these signs, which have now
almost passed into traditions, and are only to be
learned, moreover, from some ingenuous <i>hanum</i> who
has confided them to a Christian friend. Were you
to interrogate a Turk in regard to them, you would
cover him with confusion.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We learn through the same channels what the
dress of the Turkish women is in the seclusion of
the harem&mdash;the details of that charming costume,
at once rich and fantastic, which every one has some
idea of, and which lends to every woman who wears
it the dignity of a princess and freedom and grace
of a child. We will never see it unless the fashion
should be adopted in our own country, for even
should the <i>ferajeh</i> be some day discarded, every
Turkish woman will by that time be found dressed
like a European underneath. What anguish for the
artists, and what a pity for all concerned! Just fancy
a Turkish beauty, “slender as a cypress,” with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
coloring “of all the blended tints of a rose’s petals,”
wearing a little red-velvet or silver-brocade cap
slightly on one side, her black hair falling down
over the shoulders, clad in a garment of white-silk
damask embroidered in gold, with wide, open sleeves,
and a long skirt parted in front so as to show the
full trousers of rose-colored silk falling in close folds
over little feet encased in tiny pointed slippers
turned up in Chinese fashion; a sash of green
satin around the waist, and diamonds flashing from
neck and arms and hair, the tassel of the cap, slippers,
girdle, forehead, so that she glitters from head
to foot like the Madonna in a Spanish cathedral as
she lies extended on a wide divan in an attitude of
childish grace, surrounded by a circle of pretty Circassian,
Arabian, or Persian slaves, enveloped like
statues of antiquity in long, sweeping garments; or
imagine a bride, “white as the summit of Olympus,”
arrayed in sky-blue satin with a large gold-embroidered
veil falling over her entire person, seated
upon a pearl-embroidered ottoman; or picture to
yourself the adored favorite in the most retired
apartment of the harem, wearing the jacket and
trousers which set off to the utmost advantage the
exquisite contours of her person, making her look
like a graceful, well-formed boy. Then you can
realize what those beasts of “reforming” Turks,
with their bald heads and black coats, have to answer
for. These house-costumes, however, vary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
with the changing fashions. The Turkish women,
having nothing else in the world to occupy them,
devote a large part of their time to trying to devise
some new style of dress: they cover themselves
with finery and trinkets, stick feathers and ribbons
in their hair, tie scarfs around their heads and fur
around their necks and arms, borrowing something
from all the different styles of Oriental costume;
they combine the fashions of Europe and the East,
wear wigs, dye their hair black, red, yellow, indulge
every sort of fancy, and vie with one another every
whit as much as the leaders of fashion in other
lands. If at one of the gatherings at the Sweet
Waters a fairy should suddenly wave her wand and
all the <i>ferajehs</i> fall off, no doubt we would find some
of the ladies attired like Asiatic queens, others like
French Christians or in full ball-costume or in the
gala dress of tradespeople, riding habits, Greek
costumes, gypsy dresses, or like vivandières&mdash;just
as great a variety, in short, as may be seen among
the men on the bridge of the Validêh Sultan.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The apartments occupied by beautiful and wealthy
Mohammedan ladies correspond, to a certain extent,
with their fanciful and captivating style of dress.
The rooms reserved for the women are usually well
situated, commanding charming views of sea or
country or else overlooking a wide expanse of the
city. Beneath the windows are gardens enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
between high walls covered with ivy and jasmine,
overlooked by terraces; over the street extend
small rooms built out from the walls and enclosed
with glass, like the <i>miradores</i> of Spanish houses.
The interiors are simply enchanting. Almost all the
rooms are small, the floors covered with Chinese
matting and rugs; screens painted with flowers and
fruits stand about; a wide divan runs all around the
wall, and in the centre of the room a fountain
plays; vases of flowers stand in the windows, and
over all falls that soft, subdued light so characteristic
of the Oriental house, like the dim light of the forest
or&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;the cloister or some sacred
spot, so that one is inclined to walk on tiptoe and speak
in whispers, saying nothing but what is humble and
tender, talking only of God and love. This soft,
mysterious light, the perfumes wafted in from the
gardens, the murmur of the fountains, the figures of
the slaves flitting back and forth like phantoms, the
stillness which broods over everything, the distant
blue of the Asiatic mountains seen between the bars
of the windows with their leafy screen of honeysuckle,
awaken in the breast of a European, who
finds herself for the first time within those mysterious
walls, an inexpressible sensation of languor
and of melancholy.</p>

<p>The decoration of most of these harems is simple
in the extreme, almost severe, but there are those
which are very magnificent, having walls hung with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
satin and gold damask, screens of cedar-wood, gilded
gratings, and costly furniture, from whose character
it is easy enough to judge what sort of life is
led by the inmates. You find only arm-chairs, big
and little ottomans, rugs, stools, low seats, cushions
of every possible size and shape, and mattresses
covered with shawls and brocades; everything is
soft, yielding, inviting, saying in a thousand different
ways, “Rest, take your ease: love, sleep,
dream.” Here and there are hand-mirrors and
large fans of ostrich feathers; chased chibuks hang
on the walls and bird-cages in the windows;
braziers for burning perfumes stand in the middle
of the rooms, and musical boxes, bric-à-brac, and
ornaments in every direction; sufficiently indicating
the tastes of an idle and weary woman. Nor does
this luxury exist only on the surface: in some establishments
all the table service is of gold&mdash;of
solid gold the vessels for perfumed water, of gold
the fringe of the satin napkins&mdash;while brilliants and
precious stones glitter from the various utensils, the
coffee-cups, goblets, pipes, table-linen, and fans. In
others&mdash;and these by far the greater number of
houses, it must be understood&mdash;little if any change
has been made from the ancient order of things
in the tent or hut of the Tartar, whose entire
outfit could be packed upon the back of a single
mule, and everything stood in perpetual readiness
for a fresh migration across Asia. These houses are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
distinctively Mohammedan and severe in character,
where, when the hour of departure sounds, nothing
is heard but the resigned voice of the master pronouncing
the word “Olsun!” (So be it).</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Turkish dwelling, as every one knows, is
divided into two parts, the <i>harem</i> and the <i>selamlik</i>.
The <i>selamlik</i> is the part reserved for the man. Here
he works, eats, sees his friends, takes his siesta, and
sometimes sleeps at night. The wife never enters
it, but, just as the man rules in the <i>selamlik</i>, so does
she govern in the harem. She orders and arranges
everything just as she chooses, and does whatever
she wants to, except that of course she cannot receive
male visitors. If she does not feel like seeing
her husband, she can even refuse to do that, sending
a polite message requesting him to return at some
other time. Although the <i>selamlik</i> is, as a rule,
only separated from the <i>harem</i> by one small door
and a narrow corridor, they are, in reality, like two
distinct houses, far away from one another. The
male friends of the effendi who come to see him, and
the ladies who call upon the hanum, neither encounter
nor hear each other, and frequently are mutually
unknown. In the same way, the two establishments
are supplied with different servants and very commonly
separate kitchens. Husband and wife seek
their amusements in their own way, spending their
time and their money without reference to each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
other, and rarely even dine together, having almost
nothing in common. It is very unusual for the man
to enter the harem in the character of husband or
companion or as the guide and educator of his children;
his visits are those of the lover: on crossing
that threshold, he puts away all his cares and worries,
giving himself up entirely to the soft distractions
of the moment: his object is to be amused and
diverted, and it would never occur to him to look
there for the light and guidance of a mind more
clear and serene than his own, or for even a sympathetic
interest in his affairs; and, indeed, the women
of Turkey would be found to be but poorly adapted
to satisfy such demands were they made. The husband,
moreover, is at no pains to surround himself
with that halo of wisdom or strength or intelligence
which might be calculated to increase his importance
in his wife’s eyes. What would be the use? He is
already the god of the temple, claiming worship and
adoration as a right. There is no need for him to
make himself more attractive. The honor which,
of his bounty, he pays his wife in going to see her
at all itself calls for a sentiment of gratitude sufficiently
like love to satisfy him. The word “woman”
has for him absolutely no association with the
mind or with any of his outside interests and occupations.
She belongs exclusively to his private life,
and on this account he dislikes to so much as hear
the word pronounced in public. If he has to announce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the birth of a daughter, he will say, “‘A
veiled one’ or ‘a hidden one’ or ‘a little stranger’
has been born to me.” And so it is that any real
intimacy between husband and wife is out of the
question: all those depths and secret recesses of the
soul which can only be discovered by the light of
entire mutual confidence must, from the nature of
things, remain for ever hidden; their intercourse
lacks the necessary quality of an assured footing.
The wife, never knowing at what hour she may receive
a visit from her husband, is constantly decked
out in expectation of that event: intent upon outdoing
a rival or preserving a pre-eminence which is
continually threatened, she is always something of a
courtier, doing violence to her own feelings in order
that everything may look smiling and cheerful for
her lord, and often enough, when her heart is heavy
within her, assuming the gay and laughing mien of
a happy, contented woman in order to prevent his
growing weary of and neglecting her. And so it
happens that the Turk never really knows woman as
a wife, just as he has never known her as a mother,
sister, or friend, and never will as a daughter, while
she, finding that her nobler qualities are neither
used nor prized, allows them to become blunted and
warped, valuing only those for which she is sought,
and often resolutely checking the natural and finer
dictates of her own heart in order to find, if not
happiness, at least peace, in the apathy of a purely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
animal existence. She has, it is true, the comfort
of her children, and very often her husband sends
for them to pet and caress them in her presence;
but whatever satisfaction this might have given her
is marred by the knowledge that within the hour he
may well have done the same to the children of
another wife, and an hour later be embracing those
of a third, and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;within a year of
still a fourth. Lover-like devotion, parental affection,
friendship, confidence, all, are divided and subdivided,
each portion having its own hours, regulations,
and boundaries. Hence his visit is cold and
formal, while through and beneath it all there is a
bitter humiliation, a deadly insult, in the love of a
husband who pays a eunuch to mount guard over his
wife. He says to her, in substance, “I love you,
‘my joy,’ ‘glory,’ ‘pearl of my house,’ but I am
quite sure that you cannot be trusted.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The conditions of married life, however, vary very
greatly according to the worldly possessions of the
husband, even apart from the fact that a man who
can only support one woman can, of course, have
but one wife. The rich man lives apart from his
wife in body as well as in spirit; he is able to afford
a separate suite of apartments or even a house for
her, and does so in order that he may carry on his
occupations and receive his friends and acquaintances
without running any risk of the ladies of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
household being seen or interfered with. The Turk
of moderate means is forced, from motives of economy,
to live on terms of much greater familiarity
with his wife, and, dwelling under the same roof,
sees her much more frequently. The poor Turk is
obliged to occupy the smallest possible space, and so
eats, sleeps, and passes all his leisure time in the
company of his wife and children. Wealth divides,
while poverty unites. The life led in the houses of
the poor differs very little whether the inmates be
Turks or Christians. The woman who cannot keep
a slave does the work herself, and labor increases
her dignity and authority. Not infrequently she
may even be found routing her lazy husband out of
the neighboring café or tavern and driving him home
with blows from her slipper. Here, at least, husband
and wife are on an equality: they spend their
evenings together, seated side by side in the doorway
of their house, and in the more retired suburbs
even go together, sometimes, to make the family
purchases. Not infrequently you may see in an
out-of-the-way cemetery a father and mother, with
their children gathered around them, seated near the
grave of some relative, eating their luncheon, just
like a laboring family in any other part of the
world; and from the mere fact that it is uncommon,
one finds himself strangely moved by this simple
scene. You realize, as you watch them, how
natural, how essential, and eternally and universally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
fitting is that junction of soul and body; that in
that group, so complete in itself, there is no room
for any one else; that a single additional note and
the harmony would be spoiled or destroyed outright;
that, talk and argue as you may, the fact remains
that the first condition, the elementary force, the
cornerstone of an orderly and well-balanced society,
is there before you; that every and any other combination
of affections and interests violates a natural
law; that this is a family, the other a herd; that
this, and this only, corresponds to a home, the other
to a wolf’s den.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There are those who maintain that the women of
the East are not only satisfied with polygamy, but
that they do not so much as understand its injustice.
To believe this one would have to be ignorant, I do
not say of Oriental life, but of the human heart
itself. And how is it, if this be so, that almost every
Turkish girl, when she agrees to marry, makes it a
condition that during her lifetime there shall be no
other wife, or that large numbers of wives return to
their own homes on account of the husband’s failure
to keep this promise? and what is the meaning of
the Turkish proverb, “A house with four wives, a
vessel in a storm”? And even supposing her husband
worships her, an Oriental woman can hardly
fail to curse polygamy, obliging her, as it does, to
live with that sword of Damocles suspended over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
her head&mdash;the daily dread of a rival, not hidden and
distant and always in the wrong, as the rival of a
European wife must necessarily be, but installed
beside her in the same house, with the same name,
and entitled to equal rights with herself. She is
liable at any time to have one of her own slaves suddenly
lift her head in her presence, treat her as an
equal, and have children whose rights are the same
as those of her own. It is quite impossible that she
should be blind to the injustice of such a state of
things; and when the husband whom she loves introduces
another wife into his house, it may well
happen that, reflecting upon the fact that he is but
taking advantage of the code of the Prophet, and
knowing full well at the bottom of her heart that an
older and more sacred law has denounced that act as
an infamous abuse of power, she rebels against and
curses the conditions which have taken her husband
from her, cut the knot which bound them together,
and destroyed the happiness of her life. On the
other hand, suppose she does not love him: she
still has good cause to detest a law which so
seriously interferes with the rights of her children,
wounds her self-respect, and permits her husband to
either neglect her altogether or seek her society
solely from motives in which affection plays no part.
It may be urged that Turkish women know that such
misfortunes as these sometimes overtake European
women as well: perhaps they do, but they also know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that the latter are not obliged by the law, both civil
and religious, to treat with respect and give the
title of sister to the women who have poisoned their
lives, and have, moreover, the comfort of being
looked upon as martyrs, as well as a hundred ways
of vindicating and consoling themselves without the
husband being once able to say, as the polygamist
can to his rebellious wife, “I have a right to love a
hundred women, while it is your duty to love no one
but me.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Turkish woman has, however, many rights
and privileges under the law to console her. She is
treated on all hands with a certain chivalric tenderness.
No man would dare to raise a hand against
her in public. Not a soldier, even in the midst of
the general license and disorder of a riot, would
attempt to maltreat even the most insolent woman
of the people. The husband observes toward his
wife a sort of formal deference, and the mother
is always the object of especial veneration. Nor
would a man dream of making his wife work in
order that she might support him. It is the husband
who settles the dot upon his wife; she is expected
to bring him nothing but her wedding outfit
and some female slaves. In cases of repudiation or
divorce he is obliged to provide for her maintenance,
and this is also the case when he treats her
badly and she demands a separation in consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
The facility of divorce remedies, to some
small extent, the unfortunate consequences of marriages
made almost always in the dark on account
of the peculiar conditions of Turkish society, which
oblige the two sexes to live entirely apart. It requires
very little to enable a woman to obtain a divorce:
it is only necessary to show that her husband
has ill-treated her once, or spoken of her in conversation
with others in offensive terms, or neglected
her for a certain length of time. When she has a
complaint to make, she has only to lay her grievance
before the court in writing, or she may, if she
choose, present it in person before a vizier&mdash;the grand
vizier himself, if she wishes to&mdash;he being almost
always ready to receive and listen to her kindly and
patiently. If she cannot get on with his other
wives, she may require her husband to provide her
with a separate establishment, to which, indeed, she
has a right in any case, or at least to separate apartments.
The husband is forbidden to take either as
wife or odalisque any slave whom his wife has
brought from her father’s house. A woman who has
been betrayed and abandoned can require the man
to marry her unless he already has four wives: in
that case she can oblige him to support her in his
house and recognize her children. There are no illegitimate
children in Turkey. Bachelors and old
maids are very rare, and forced marriages far less
common than one would suppose, as the guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
fathers are liable to punishment under the law. The
state pensions all widows without relatives or means,
and also provides support for orphans; often female
children who have been abandoned are taken from
the street by women of wealth, who educate and
marry them off, and it is unusual for women to be
reduced to absolute want. Now, all of this is not
only true, but very admirable, but at the same time
one cannot refrain from laughing outright when the
Turks solemnly compare the social privileges enjoyed
by their women with those of European countries,
to the advantage of the former, or try to persuade
us that they are blessed with an immunity
from the corruption which, they declare, exists
among us. What possible value in the eyes of a
woman is an outward show of respect, when her very
position as a suppliant wife is in itself a humiliation?
Of what avail the facility of divorce and
right it gives her to remarry, when the second
husband can at any time repeat the offence for
which she left the first? What great matter is it
for a man to be required to recognize his illegitimate
son, when he has not the means to support him, and
can have fifty others “legitimately,” who, if they
are spared the opprobious epithet of “bastard,” are
not spared from want and neglect? The social evils
which exist in European lands are to be found in
Turkey under different conditions and names, and
the fact that they are tolerated, and even sanctioned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
certainly does not extenuate them, while it may
and does make them more common. For a Turk to
attempt to criticise any one else in this regard is to
the last degree blind and fatuous.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>From the foregoing it is very easy to imagine
what sort of women the Turkish ones are&mdash;merely
“pleasing females” for the most part, who, barely
knowing how to read and write, as a matter of fact
do neither; miraculous beings those who have a little
superficial smattering of education. It would not be
agreeable to the men, in whose eyes they are endowed
with “long hair and little brains,” for them
to cultivate their minds, as it might be very inconvenient
were they to become equal in this respect,
or even superior to, themselves. And so, as they
never read and are debarred from picking up any
stray crumbs of knowledge by association with men,
they grow up in a state of crass ignorance. The
separation of the sexes also results in the loss of
gentleness on the one hand and of high-mindedness
on the other. The men grow rough as they grow
older, and the women become gossips: even in old
age, from never having moved in any society beyond
the narrow circle of their female friends and relatives,
the women retain something puerile in all
their ideas and habits, are excessively curious,
everything astonishes them, and they make a great
deal out of every trifle; they have spiteful little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
tricks, too, and are inclined to look down on and despise
education; they burst out laughing when any
one speaks to them, and pass hours at a time over the
most childish games, such as chasing each other from
room to room, and snatching sugar-plums out of one
another’s mouths. On the other hand, to paraphrase
the French saying, they have good qualities in their
defects: their natures are frank and open, easily
read at a glance; they impress you as being “real
persons,” as Madame de Sévigne said of them, not
masques or caricatures or apes; free, natural, and,
even when they are unhappy, “<i>all of one piece</i>;”
and if, as it is said, one of them has only to affirm
and reaffirm a thing for every one to discredit it, it
only means that she has too little art to deceive with
success. At all events&mdash;and it is no small praise&mdash;there
are no dull blue-stockings among them, or
wearisome pedagogues who can talk of nothing but
language and style, or those spiritual creatures who
dwell on a loftier plane than ordinary mortals. It is,
however, perfectly true that in their narrow lives,
cut off from all elevating association or occupation,
with the instinctive desire of youth and beauty for
love and admiration constantly thwarted and dissatisfied,
their souls remain undeveloped. When
once an evil passion gets control of them, having
none of the checks and self-restraints imposed by
education, they run into violent excesses. Their
idle, purposeless life fosters the growth of all manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of foolish tastes, which they pursue with the utmost
obstinacy, determined to satisfy them at whatever
cost. Moreover, in the sensual air of the
harem, surrounded constantly by women inferior
to themselves in birth and education, and away
from men, whose presence would act as a check,
they abandon themselves to the most indecent
crudities of language; ignorant of all shades of expression,
they say things right out with brutal frankness,
using words at which they ought to blush, and
indulging in equivocal jests, becoming at times
openly abusive and insolent: sometimes the ears of
a European who understands Turkish are treated to
a flood of invective and abuse directed against a
rude or impolitic shopkeeper, which, coming as it
does from the lips of a <i>hanum</i> to all outward appearance
of the highest breeding, would never, among
us, be heard from the mouth of any but the lowest
class of women. It seems as though their virulence
increased in proportion with their knowledge of
European customs and intercourse with the women
of other lands&mdash;as though the spirit of rebellion was
stirred up within them by these means. A Turkish
woman, finding herself really beloved by her husband,
takes advantage of the fact to visit him with
all manner of petty acts of tyranny in revenge for the
great social tyranny of which she is the victim: she
is often represented as being all sweetness and
bashful timidity, but there are fierce, bold spirits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
as well, and in popular uprisings it is not uncommon
to find women in the front ranks: they
assemble and arm themselves, and stop the carriages
of unpopular viziers, covering them with abuse,
stoning them, and forcibly resisting arrest. They
are, indeed, like all other women, sweet and gentle
when unmoved by passion, treat their slaves with
great kindness when they are not jealous of them,
and are tender and affectionate with their children,
though even if they were willing to take the trouble
to have them educated or trained, they have
no idea how to set about it. They contract the most
ardent friendships with each other, especially those
who are separated from their husbands or are suffering
from the same kind of misfortune: these friendships
are of the most exaggerated character; they
wear the same colors, use the same perfumes, put on
patches of the same size and shape, and make enthusiastic
demonstrations and protestations of undying
regard. I might add here the remark that has
been made by more than one lady traveller from
Europe, that there “exist among them all the vices
of ancient Babylon,” were I not unwilling in so serious
a matter to make a statement which rests
wholly on the assertions of others.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The manners of Turkish women reflect their characters.
They are all more or less like young girls
of good family, who, having been brought up in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
country and arrived at the transition stage between
childhood and womanhood, keep their mothers in a
constant state of uneasiness by their want of conventionality.
It is very funny to hear a European
lady’s account of a visit to a harem. The <i>hanum</i>,
for instance, after sitting for the first few moments
in a dignified attitude upon the sofa, just as she sees
her visitor doing, will suddenly and without any
warning clasp her hands over her head, or begin to
yawn loudly or to nurse one of her knees. Accustomed
to the liberty, not to say license, of the harem,
and to the easy attitudes of idleness and fatigue,
and weakened as they are by their prolonged and frequent
baths, they quickly tire in any erect or constrained
position, and, throwing themselves on the
divan, toss continually from one side to the other,
twist and tangle up their long trains, roll themselves
into balls, catch hold of their feet, put a cushion
on their knees and rest their elbows upon it,
straighten themselves out, twist, turn, stretch, arch
their backs like cats, roll from the divan on to the
mattress, from the mattress on to the rug, from the
rug on to the marble pavement, and go to sleep
like children wherever and whenever they happen
to feel sleepy. One French lady traveller declares
that they are something like mollusks, and they are
nearly always in such a position that one could take
them in his arms like a ball. Their most conventional
attitude is sitting cross-legged, and it is said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
that the defect of slightly crooked legs so common
among them comes from their having sat in this
position since childhood. But how gracefully they
do it! You can see them in the public gardens and
cemeteries. They drop straight down without so
much as putting out a hand, erect as statues, and
rise with the same ease, perfectly straight and without
leaning upon anything, as though they were
being drawn out. But this is about the only free,
strong movement they have. The grace of a Turkish
woman seems to consist entirely in those attitudes
of repose which display to their best advantage the
charming curves of her figure. With head thrown
back, hair streaming loosely over the pillow, and
arms hanging down, she can draw money and jewels
from the husband’s pocket and drive the unfortunate
eunuch to the verge of despair.</p>

<p>Nor is the practice of such arts as these the only
occupation by which they seek to enliven the deadly
monotony of the greater number of lives passed in
a harem&mdash;a monotony resulting not so much from
the absence of employment and distractions as from
their all being so much alike, just as certain books
are tiresome from their uniformity of style, while
their subjects may be entirely different. They do
everything in their power to combat ennui: the
whole day is often nothing but a prolonged struggle
with this dreaded enemy. Seated upon rugs and
cushions, with their slaves grouped around them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
they hem innumerable little handkerchiefs to give
away to their friends; embroider night-caps and
tobacco-pouches as presents for their husbands,
fathers, and brothers; tell the beads of the <i>tespi</i> a
hundred times; count as high as they know how;
spend hours at a time watching the movements of
the ships on the Bosphorus or Sea of Marmora from
the small round windows of their elevated apartments;
or weave interminable romances of love and
liberty and riches as they watch the smoke from
their cigarettes curl upward in blue wreaths. Tired
of their cigarettes, they betake themselves to the
chibuk and inhale the “blond hair of Latakia,”
then a cup of Syrian coffee and a few sweetmeats,
or some fruit or an ice, which they can spend half
an hour in eating; then comes a little more smoking,
the narghileh this time, perfumed with rose-water,
and after it a piece of mastic gum, which
they suck to get rid of the taste of the smoke;
then some lemonade to do away with the taste of the
mastic. They dress and undress, try on all their
costumes, make experiments with all the colors in
their little boxes, put on and take off patches cut
like stars and crescents; and arrange a dozen or so
mirrors and hand-glasses in such a way that they can
see themselves on all sides; finally, when they are
tired out, two young slaves will dance for their
amusement accompanied by tambourine and tabor,
while a third repeats the well-known song or fairy-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>tale
that every one can say by heart, or the usual
couple of mascottes dressed like acrobats perform
the regular wrestling-match, which always ends in a
stamp on the floor and an artificial, mirthless laugh.
Sometimes a troupe of Egyptian dancers will present
themselves, and this event is made the excuse for
a little fête, or a gypsy comes and the <i>hanum</i> must
have her fortune told from the palm of her hand, or
purchase a talisman that will preserve her youth, or
a decoction to bring her children, or a love-philter.
She will pass hours with her face pressed against
the window-grating watching the people and dogs
pass in the street below, or teaching the parrot a
new word; then go to the garden to swing: returning
to the house, she says her prayers or throws
herself upon the divan to play a game of cards;
then a visitor is announced and she jumps up to
receive her, and there follows the customary round
of coffee, tobacco, lemonade, and sweetmeats, of
empty laughter and tremendous yawns, until, the
visitor having departed, the eunuch appears in the
doorway, saying in a low voice, “The effendi.”&mdash;“At
last! Really, Providence has sent him; I don’t
care if he were the ugliest husband in Stambul.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Such is the life in a harem where there is at least
peace, if nothing more, but there are others in
which the dulness is relieved, not to say annihilated,
by the storms of passion which sweep across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
them, and there the life is something altogether different.
All is peaceable enough in a harem where
there is but one wife whose husband loves her, pays
no attention to the slaves, and has no outside intrigues.
There is also, if not happiness, quiet, in
those where the several wives are equally cold or
indifferent, none of them caring particularly for the
husband, who on his part does not distinguish among
them, but bestows upon each in turn a sufficient
amount of attention&mdash;where no one is impelled by
love or jealousy or ambition to try to supersede the
others. These good-natured wives have for a common
object the getting as much money as possible
out of the effendi; they occupy the same house,
never quarrel, call each other sister, and join in one
another’s amusement. The boat is made after the
devil’s pattern, but it goes ahead all the same, and
there is peace or the semblance of it, in a harem
where the wife, finding herself set aside to make
room for another, accepts the situation in a spirit of
resignation, and, while declining the shreds of love
her husband is still willing to allow her, continues to
live in his house on friendly terms with him and the
other inmates, consoling herself in a sort of dignified
retirement with the society of her children.
But when, as is sometimes the case, it is a question
of a woman of high spirit and fiery passions, it is
an altogether different matter. She declines to submit
quietly to her rival’s triumph or to the shame of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
desertion, and will not consent without a fight to see
her children set aside to make room for those of a
new-comer. Life in one of these harems is a fore-taste
of the infernal regions. There are weeping
and lamentation, breaking of crockery and glass;
slaves die from having long pins driven into
them; plots are hatched, crimes contemplated, and
sometimes committed&mdash;stabbing, poisoning, or throwing
vitriol in the face of the enemy. Existence is
nothing but a series of persecutions, implacable
hatreds, fierce and deadly acts of revenge. The
man, in short, who has several wives must either, if
he loves one, sacrifice his peace, or else care for
them equally and purchase quiet at the expense of
love; in either case he usually walks straight to his
ruin. If his wives are not jealous by reason of their
love for him, they are from motives of ambition and
rivalry in luxury and dress. So, then, if he gives his
favorite a piece of jewelry or a carriage or a villa on
the Bosphorus, he has to do the same for each of the
others, or he soon has the house down about his ears,
and so buys his peace for its weight in gold. And
the same difficulties extend to the children, those of
the neglected mother being filled with hatred and
envy for those of the favorite; and it is not hard
to imagine what sort of training they must get,
brought up in harems whose very air is heavy with
violence and intrigue, surrounded by slaves and
eunuchs, with no help from their fathers, no examples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
set them of application or self-control, in that
sensual, enervating atmosphere, the little girls in
especial being taught from earliest infancy to build
all their hopes of future success upon their ability to
arouse a sentiment for which “love” seems too lofty
a title, and receiving the necessary training partly
from their own mothers, partly from slaves, and
mostly from Kara-Gyuz.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There are, besides the peaceful and tempestuous,
two other types of harem&mdash;that of the young and
liberal-minded Turk, who encourages his wife in
the cultivation of European ideas, and that of the
Turk of the old school, who is either strict by
nature or else is under the influence of relatives,
especially of an old mother if she happens to be
one of those inflexible Mussulman women sternly
opposed to change of any sort, and determined that
he shall manage his house according to her ideas.
Nothing can exceed the contrast between the two.
The former has the air of a European lady’s house:
there is a piano on which the <i>hanum</i> is being taught
to play by a Christian music-mistress; there are
work-tables, straw chairs, a bedstead, and writing-desk;
a good crayon portrait of the effendi by an
Italian artist of Pera hangs on the wall; in one corner
stands a small bookcase containing two or three
dozen books, among which may be found a little
French and Turkish dictionary and the last number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of <i>La Mode illustrée</i>, which is sent to the mistress
by the wife of the Spanish consul after she has done
with it; moreover, there is a complete box of water-colors,
with which the <i>hanum</i> paints fruits and
flowers, and she assures her friends that she never
suffers for a moment from ennui. Among other
things, she is writing her memoirs, and at a certain
hour of the day her French master arrives to practise
French conversation with her (of course it must
be understood that he is old and bent and feeble).
Sometimes a German female photographer comes
from Galata to take her photograph. When she is
ill a European doctor attends her, who may even be
young and handsome, her husband not being such a
jealous beast as some of his more antiquated friends;
and now and then a French dressmaker is summoned
to cut and fit a costume in the very latest style as it is
given in the fashion-plates, so that she may give her
husband a charming surprise on the following Thursday
evening, that being the special feast-day of
Mussulman couples, when the effendi pays particular
court to his “rose-leaf.” And then the effendi,
being a person of high position, has promised that
she may watch the first large ball given at the
English embassy during the following winter from
the crack of some retired doorway. In short, the
<i>hanum</i> is a European lady of the Mussulman faith,
who says to her friends with intense satisfaction,
“I live like a <i>Cocona</i>”&mdash;a Christian. And her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
friends and relatives, though they may be unable to
do the same, would like to; and among themselves
they talk of the fashions and theatres, telling each
other stories of the “superstitions,” the “pedantries,”
and the “bigotry” of Old Turkey, winding up every
discourse with the remark, “And it is high time that
we should change all this and begin to lead lives
more like rational human beings.”</p>

<p>But that other harem! Here there is nothing
that is not severely Turkish, from the costume of
the mistress to the smallest article of furniture&mdash;not
a book except the Koran, the only newspaper the
<i>Stambul</i>. Should the <i>hanum</i> fall ill, instead of a doctor,
one of those innumerable Turkish doctresses,
with a miraculous specific for every kind of disease,
is summoned. If her parents have become tainted
with the European craze, they are only permitted to
see their daughter once a week. Every door and
window in the house is furnished with bars and
bolts: absolutely nothing European but the air is
allowed to enter the household, unless the mistress
has unfortunately been taught a little French in her
girlhood, in which case the mother-in-law is perfectly
capable of thrusting a coarse romance of the
worst type into her hands, so as to be able to say,
“There! you see now what fine sort of people these
are you are so crazy to imitate! what pretty things
they do and say! what a beautiful example they
set!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
And, notwithstanding all their restrictions, Turkish
women’s lives are full of plots and schemes and scandals
to a degree that at first sight would seem impossible
in a society where there is so little direct communication
between the two sexes. In one household,
for example, the old mother has made up her mind
to prejudice her son against one of his wives, so that
another, her favorite, may occupy the chief place.
So she tries, among other things, to keep the first
one’s children in the background and prevent them
from being educated or made attractive in their
father’s eyes, hoping that he may neglect them for
those of the second. In another the deserted wife
revenges herself upon her rival by throwing a beautiful
slave, whom she has sought over land and sea,
in the husband’s way, hoping to make him leave the
second one, as he has her. Another with a genius
for matchmaking manages so that one of her own
family shall see and fall in love with a certain young
girl of her acquaintance, and by marrying her himself
balk her husband, whom she suspects of having
views in the same direction. A number of wealthy
women club together to purchase and present a
handsome slave to the Sultan or the grand vizier, to
further some private scheme they have on hand;
other women of good family, by means of secret
wirepulling and their influence over powerful relatives,
can accomplish almost anything they want&mdash;the
disgrace of a prominent official, the elevation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
a friend, the divorce of this one, the dismissal of
that to some distant province; and, although there is
so much less social intercourse than among us, they
do not know any less about one another’s affairs. A
woman’s reputation for wit or insane jealousy or
stupidity or a slanderous tongue extends far beyond
the circle of her immediate acquaintances, while a
clever speech or one of those plays upon words to
which the Turkish language lends itself so admirably
flies from mouth to mouth and is repeated far and
wide. Births, marriages, circumcisions, fêtes, every
little event which occurs in the European colony or
the Seraglio, forms the subject of endless talk and
gossip: “Have you seen the new bonnet of the
French ambassadress?&mdash;Who knows anything about
the pretty Georgian slave the Validêh Sultan is
going to give the Pâdishah on the feast of Great
Bairam?&mdash;Is it true that Ahmed-Pasha’s wife was
seen the day before yesterday in European shoes
trimmed with silk tassels?&mdash;Have the costumes for
the ‘Bourgeois gentilhomme’ they are going to
perform in the Seraglio theatre actually come at
last?&mdash;Mahmûd Effendi’s wife has been going for a
week past to the Bayezid mosque to pray for twins.&mdash;There
has been a scandal in connection with such
and such a photographer’s shop in the Rue de Pera,
on account of Ahmed Effendi’s having found his
wife’s picture among the photographs.&mdash;Madame
Ayscé drinks wine.&mdash;Madame Fatima has ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
visiting-cards.&mdash;Some one saw Madame Hafiten go
in a Frank shop at three o’clock, and she never
came out till four.”</p>

<p>The chronicle of petty gossip and malicious tattle
flies in and out among those innumerable little yellow
and red houses with incredible rapidity, circulates
about the court, crosses over to Skutari, proceeds
along both banks of the Bosphorus as far as
the Black Sea, and not infrequently, finding its way
to the large provincial cities, returns from thence
with each particular added to and embellished to
provoke fresh mirth and gossip in the thousand
harems of the great metropolis.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>If you could only meet in Constantinople one of
those walking society chronicles with which all
European cities are provided, who know everything
about everybody and are always quite willing to
impart their knowledge, it would be beyond measure
amusing and instructive to get him to station
himself by your side at the entrance to the Sweet
Waters of Europe on some great fête-day and whisper
a word or two about every noteworthy person
who passed by. There could certainly be no better
method of obtaining an insight into Constantinople
manners and customs. But, after all, what difference
does it make whether we have his help or not? As
long as the incidents are perfectly well known, we
can imagine the people for ourselves: for my part,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
it is just as though I stood there looking and listening.
The people stream by, and our Turkish gossip
points and whispers: “Do you see that lady passing
now? She has quarrelled with her husband and gone
to Skutari to live: that, you know, is where they all
go when they are discontented or have a falling
out with their husbands. She is staying with a
friend, and will wait until her effendi, who at bottom
is really very fond of her, shall go and tell her that
the slave who caused the trouble has been gotten rid
of, and conduct her home again pacified.&mdash;This
effendi is in the Foreign Office: he has just done
what numbers of others do to avoid being pestered
to death with relations-in-law and relations of relations-in-law&mdash;that
is, married an Arabian slave: his
sister is giving her her first lessons in Turkish.&mdash;That
handsome woman over there is a divorcée. When
Effendi So-and-so has succeeded in repudiating one
of his four wives, she is to take her place, having
been promised it some time ago.&mdash;That one just
behind her has been divorced twice from the same
man, and now she wants to marry him again, he
wishing it as well. So she is about, in obedience to
the law governing such cases, to marry some one
else, whose wife she must be for twenty-four hours,
after which the capricious fair one is free to marry
her first husband for the third time.&mdash;The brunette
yonder with the expressive eyes was an Abyssinian
slave who was sent by a great lady of Cairo as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
present to a great lady of Stambul; on dying the
latter left her the post of mistress of the establishment.&mdash;That
effendi is fifty years old, and has had
ten wives, but the old lady near him dressed in
green has done better yet, having been the lawful
wife of no less than twelve husbands.&mdash;There goes
a personage who makes her living by purchasing
young girls of fourteen or so, and, after teaching
them music, singing, dancing, and the manners of
good society, resells them at a premium of five
hundred per cent.&mdash;Now, there goes a very handsome
woman whose exact value I happen to know:
she is a Circassian bought at Topkhâneh for one
hundred and twenty Turkish francs, and resold three
years later for a bagatelle of four hundred.&mdash;This
one near us, who is adjusting her veil, has had a
somewhat checkered career. She began as a slave;
then she was an odalisque; then she married, was
divorced, and married again; at present she is a
widow and is looking about for some fresh matrimonial
venture.&mdash;Do you see that effendi? Well, you
could hardly guess what has happened in his household:
his wife has fallen in love with a eunuch, and
they say that if he does not look out there will be
something queer in his coffee one of these days, and
she will be free to end her life in peace with the
object of her choice; nor will it be the first time
that that kind of thing has happened.&mdash;There is a
merchant who has married his four wives with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
eye to business: he keeps one in Constantinople, one
in Trebizond, one in Salonika, and one in Alexandria.
Thus at the end of each journey he finds a home
awaiting him.&mdash;There is a handsome young pasha
only twenty-four years old: a month ago he was
nothing but a poor subaltern in the Imperial Guard,
whom the Sultan promoted at a bound, so as to
marry him to one of his sisters; but he is not an
object of envy to the other men, for it is no joke to
be the husband of one of the sultanas: as every one
knows, they are as ‘jealous as nightingales.’ Probably
were we to search through the crowd we would
find a slave dogging his footsteps now, so as to note
and report every one whom he either does or does
not look at.&mdash;See that slender, graceful figure over
there? One need not be very discriminating to
know her at once for a flower from the Seraglio.
She was one of the Sultan’s beauties: a few months
ago an official of the War Office, who has managed
to ingratiate himself at court, obtained her
hand in marriage, and before long he will mount
rapidly.&mdash;That little five-year-old girl was betrothed
to-day to a youngster of eight. The groom elect was
taken to see her, and, finding her to his taste,
promptly flew into a violent passion because a small
boy cousin about a yard high kissed her in his
presence.&mdash;There goes an old hag who had two
sheep killed the day before yesterday in gratitude to
Allah for having removed a daughter-in-law whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
she hated.&mdash;There goes the wife of a friend of mine
with her face completely covered and wearing a lilac
<i>ferajeh</i>: he is a Turk, but she is a Christian and
goes to church every Sunday: don’t speak of it,
though, to any one&mdash;on her account, not his. The
Koran does not forbid such marriages: for one of
the faithful to purify himself from the embrace of
an unbeliever he has only to wash the face and
hands.&mdash;Ah! what have we missed! One of the
Seraglio carriages has just gone by with the Sultan’s
third <i>kaydyn</i> inside: I recognized it by the rose-colored
ribbon around the lackey’s neck. She was
a present from the pasha of Smyrna, and is said to
have the largest eyes and smallest mouth in the empire&mdash;a
face very much on the order of that of the
pretty little <i>hanum</i> with an arched nose who scandalized
Christian and Mussulman alike the other day
by flirting openly with an English artist of my acquaintance.
Little wretch! When the two angels,
Nekir and Munkir, come to judge her soul, she
thinks she will be able to get out of it with the usual
fib, saying her eyes were shut at the moment, so she
did not see that it was an unbeliever.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So then there are faithless wives among the Turks
as well? There are, indeed, notwithstanding the
jealousy of the effendis and vigilance of the eunuchs;
notwithstanding the hundred blows of the whip
with which the Koran threatens to punish the guilty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
one; notwithstanding the fact of the Turkish husbands
being all banded together in a sort of society
for mutual protection, and that an entirely opposite
state of things from that existing in other countries
obtains there, everything seeming to conspire tacitly
to ensure conjugal felicity. It may almost be affirmed
that the “veiled” of Constantinople commit no fewer
indiscretions than their unveiled sisters of most
Christian cities. Were this not the case, why should
the word <i>Kerata</i>&mdash;which, translated into mythological
nomenclature, would read Menelaos&mdash;be heard so
frequently upon the lips of Kara-Gyuz? But you
say, How is it possible? Well, in any number of ways:
first, it must be remembered that women are no
longer flung into the Bosphorus, either in bags or
out of them, and that the bastinado on the soles of
the feet, fasting, hair-cloth, enforced silence, and so
on are punishments which have become merely idle
threats in the mouth of some brutal <i>Kerata</i>. The
jealous husband still does all in his power to protect
his rights, but when he fails he no longer indulges
in the violent scenes or summary administrations of
justice of former times, it being now much more
difficult to keep the knowledge of these little domestic
tragedies within the walls of one’s own house.
Moreover, a dread of being laughed at is one of
the influences which have crept in along with other
European ideas. The Turk’s jealousy, too, is a cold,
apathetic, corporeal affair, proceeding more from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
self-esteem than from love for another, and, although
bitter and suspicious, and even vindictive, it is not,
in the nature of things, to be compared for vigilance
and watchfulness with that which springs from a
real and passionate devotion. And, then, who is
going to undertake to watch a wife living apart from
her husband&mdash;that is, in a separate establishment,
where the husband does not even go every day?
Who is going to follow her every time she goes out
through all those intricate windings and twistings
of the Galata and Pera streets and lanes and retired
parts of Stambul? What is there to prevent any
handsome young aide-de-camp of the Sultan from
doing what, as a matter of fact, I did see one of
them do one day&mdash;gallop his horse close by a carriage
just at the corner of a street when the eunuch riding
ahead had his back turned and the carriage concealed
the one behind, and throw a note in the window?
And then the evenings during Ramazan when
the women can stay out till midnight, and the obliging
<i>Cocone</i>&mdash;she in especial who lives on the border
between a Mussulman and a Christian community&mdash;is
far too hospitable to refuse admittance to a Christian
gentleman just because a Mussulman lady happens
to be calling on her at the moment. There are,
however, no more of those thrilling and horrible
incidents which once were so common. Great ladies
now-a-days do not emulate the example set by a
sultana of the last century, who, when she repented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of her kindness toward a youth who had brought
the stuffs purchased in the morning to the Seraglio,
had him quietly dropped into the Bosphorus. Now
everything is as prosaic as possible, and the places
of rendezvous are usually those out-of-the-way shops
which deal in a little of everything. It is useless to
ask why the Turkish authorities do not suppress this
license, when one has only to read the regulations
issued to the police in regard to the preservation of
good behavior during the period of some popular
festivity, to see that they make every effort in their
power to do so. Most of these regulations bear upon
the conduct of women, many of them being addressed
directly to them in the shape of admonitions
and threats. For example, a woman is forbidden to
go to the rear of a shop; she must stay where she
can be seen from the street. She is forbidden to
make use of the tramways for mere amusement;
that is, she must get out at the end of the route, and
cannot return immediately by the same line. She is
forbidden to make signs to the people who pass her,
to stop here, to go there, to linger longer than a
certain specified time in a given place; and so on.
Any one can easily imagine for himself to what
extent such regulations as these can be enforced.
And then there is that blessed veil: originally introduced
in the interests of the men, it is now used as
a means of outwitting them by the women, who first
wear a transparent one in order to start a flirtation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
and then a thick one in order to carry it on. It is
said to be the cause of all manner of curious situations&mdash;favored
lovers who are still ignorant of their
lady-loves’ identity; women who hide themselves
under others’ names in order to carry out some
scheme of revenge; practical jokes, unexpected encounters,
and scrapes which give rise to any amount
of gossip and idle talk.</p>

<p>The place to hear all these things is the bath-house:
here every rumor and fresh bit of scandal
is discussed and commented upon and remodelled
ready to be served up afresh. The bath is, in fact,
the great rendezvous of the Turkish women, taking,
to some extent, the place of the theatre in their lives:
they go there in couples or parties, accompanied by
their slaves carrying rugs and cushions, toilet articles,
sweetmeats, and sometimes even their luncheon when
they propose remaining the entire day. As many as
two hundred women are sometimes assembled in
those dimly-lighted rooms lined with marbles and
musical with running fountains. The picture made
by these nymph-like forms flitting about in the
airiest of costumes is, according to those European
ladies who have seen it, enough to paralyze the fingers
of an artist. There are <i>hanums</i> whose dazzling
skin contrasts strikingly with that of their ebony-colored
slaves; handsome matronly figures, which
fulfil an old-fashioned Turk’s ideal of feminine loveliness;
slim young wives with their short hair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
turned up, looking like little girls; Circassians
whose tresses fall like a golden shower below their
knees; Turkish women with jet-black hair divided
into a hundred or more locks hanging over the
breast and shoulders, while others have theirs
arranged in any quantity of wavy little tufts, like
an enormous wig. One wears an amulet around her
neck, another a bit of garlic bound to her head to
avert the evil eye; there are savages with tattooed
arms, and little ladies of fashion whose tender skin
betrays the stays and shoes of modern civilization;
while the shoulders of more than one poor slave bear
witness to the existence of a eunuch’s whip. Everywhere
groups are to be seen in an endless variety
of graceful abandonment. Some lie stretched out
full length upon rugs smoking, others are having
their hair combed out by slaves; some are embroidering,
some singing, laughing, chasing one another
and throwing water about like children; shrill
screams come from the shower-baths; here a party
of friends are seated in a circle having a little feast
together; towels fly through the air, pitched from
one group to another. The less covering they have
on their bodies, the more they seem to reveal the
childishness of their natures. They are very fond
of comparing their good points, measuring their feet,
weighing their comparative attractions. One observes,
candidly, “I am beautiful;” another, “I am
passable.” A third wishes she had not such and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
such a defect, while a fourth says to her friend,
“Why, do you know, you are prettier than I?” or
one is heard saying to another reproachfully, “Just
see how terribly fat Madame Ferideh has gotten;
and you telling her to eat rice-balls, when you know
she ought to live on dried crabs!” When an amiable
<i>cocona</i> is present they all crowd around and ply her
with questions: “Is it true that you go to balls with
your neck bare down to here? What does your
effendi think of it? And what do the other men
say? How do they hold you when you dance?
This way? Really and truly? Well, I will believe
such things when I see them!”</p>

<p>Not only at the bath, but everywhere else and on
all possible occasions, they try their best to meet
and talk with Europeans, being especially delighted
if they can manage to receive one in their own
homes. On such occasions a number of friends are
asked to meet her, all the women of the establishment
are marshalled in force, and a small feast is prepared
at which the guest is crammed with fruit and sweetmeats,
and seldom allowed to depart without receiving
a present of some sort. Of course it is not a mere
wish to be hospitable that moves the <i>hanum</i> to take
this trouble, but curiosity; and so, just so soon as
she feels sufficiently at ease with her new friend,
she begins to ask questions, inquiring into every
minutest detail of European life, examining her
costume piece by piece, from the bonnet to the shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and will not rest satisfied until, having persuaded
the foreigner to accompany her to the bath, she can see
for herself how those extraordinary women are made
who study all sorts of things, paint, write for publication,
work in public offices, ride on horseback, and
climb to the tops of lofty mountains. Since the
“reform” movement set in, making this sort of
intercourse possible, the Turkish women have
abandoned some of the more extraordinary ideas
they once entertained regarding their European
sisters, which made them look upon them with
dislike and contempt, and mistrust even their education
and breeding, which, moreover, they were quite
unable to appreciate. Now it is quite different.
They realize their own ignorance, and are ashamed
of it, and, very much afraid of seeming childish or
ill-mannered, they are consequently far more reserved
than formerly, and it is hard to get them to talk in
the same frank, ingenuous way they once did: every
year they imitate the West more and more in their
dress and customs, studying European languages&mdash;not
from any especial thirst for knowledge, but so as
to be more like other people, and to enable them to
converse with Christians or introduce French words
into their conversation; even those who do not
speak French pretend that they understand it at
least, and they all love dearly to be called “Madame,”
sometimes frequenting certain Frankish shops for no
other purpose; and Pera, the all-powerful, attracts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
them as the candle does the moth; their footsteps,
their imaginations, and their money, all are irresistibly
drawn in that direction, to say nothing of the field it
affords for their little shortcomings. Their eager desire
to make friends among European women is perfectly
natural: they are to them like revelations of another
world. They are never weary of hearing descriptions
of some grand theatrical performance or ball
or state reception&mdash;of the doings of women of the
world, the brilliant society, adventures during
Carnival time, long journeys, and all the other
strange features of that wonderful Western life;
and these glowing scenes take complete possession
of the poor little brains, sick to death of the dull
monotony of the harem and gloomy shadow of the
garden-walls. Just as Europeans dream of the
mystery and dreamy tranquillity of the Orient, they
sigh enviously for the varied and feverish life of the
West, and would willingly exchange all the splendors
of the Bosphorus for a gloomy quarter of Paris.
It is really, though, not so much the excitement and
variety of society that they want: the feature which
they care most about and long for most ardently is
the domestic life, the little world of the European
house, the circle of devoted friends, the family board
surrounded with sons and daughters, the happy,
honored old age, that equal sharing of sorrow and
joy, the confidences, mutual respect, and sacred
memories which can make the union of two lives a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
beautiful and enviable thing even where there is not
passionate love&mdash;that sanctuary called “home” to
which the heart turns even after a life of wandering
and sin, a safe place of refuge even amid the storms
and passions of youth, the thought of which comforts
and sustains one in times of suffering and
misery with a promise of peace in the years to come,
like the glory of a clear sunset seen from some dark
valley.</p>

<p>But all those who really take to heart the unfortunate
lot of woman in Turkey can find comfort in
one undeniable fact&mdash;the daily increasing disfavor
with which polygamy is regarded there. The Turks
themselves have always considered it rather in the
light of a permitted abuse than man’s natural right.
Mohammed says: “He who marries but one wife
does well,” although he himself married several;
and, as a matter of fact, all those Turks who wish to
be looked up to as models in the community do have
but one; those with more, while they are not blamed
exactly, are certainly not commended. Comparatively
few Turks openly advocate polygamy, and
fewer still approve of it in their own consciences,
being, for the most part, fully alive to its injustice
and the unfortunate consequences resulting therefrom.
There is a party strongly opposed to its
practice at all, while the higher officials of state,
officers of the army, magistrates, and religious
dignitaries&mdash;all those, in short, whose social position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
requires them to adopt a certain respectability
and dignity in their mode of life&mdash;have but one wife;
and this being of necessity the case among the poor
and persons of moderate means as well, four-fifths
of the entire Mussulman population of Constantinople
are no longer polygamists. This, it is true, is
largely due to the craze for European manners and
customs, while many of them have <i>odalisques</i> in
addition to the one wife; but the European mania
itself is the result of a growing, if confused, idea
that some change in the social conditions of Mussulman
society is imperatively demanded, while the custom
of having odalisques, already openly denounced
as a vice, is sure to disappear with the suppression
of slavery&mdash;an abuse still tolerated&mdash;and become
merged into that form of corruption common
to all European countries. Will a still greater corruption
be the result? Let others be the judges;
but here are the facts. To transform Turkish into
European society the position of woman must be
established; that can only be done through the death
of polygamy, and polygamy is dying. Possibly were
the Sultan to issue a decree suppressing it outright
to-morrow, not one dissentient voice would be raised.
The edifice has crumbled to pieces, and nothing now
remains to be done but to cart away the débris.
Already the light of a new day is tingeing the
balconies of the harems with rose color. Take
heart, beautiful <i>hanums</i>! Soon the doors of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
selamlik will swing open; the bars will fall from the
windows, the <i>ferajeh</i> be relegated to the museum
of the Great Bazâr, and the word “eunuch” mean
no more than a dark memory of your youth. Then
the whole world will be free to admire your charms
of mind and person. When the “pearls of the
Orient” are spoken of in Europe, the words will
refer to the charming Mussulman women, beautiful,
refined, and witty, not to those useless stones which
adorn your foreheads amid the cold, wearisome
splendors of the harem. Be of good cheer. Surely
your sun is rising at last. For my own part, as I
tell my incredulous friends, old as I am, I have not
abandoned the hope of one day giving my arm to
the wife of a pasha passing through Turin and repeating
a few pages of <i>I Promessi Sposi</i> to her as
we walk together on the banks of the Po.</p>

I was amusing myself with such fancies as these
one morning at about five o’clock as I lay half asleep
in bed at the Hôtel de Byzance. In a sort of
dreamy vision I saw the hill of Superga in the distance,
and began to explain to my travelling <i>hanum</i>
that “that arm of the Lake of Como which extends
southward between two continuous chains&mdash;” Just
here there rose up before me the form of my friend
Yunk, candle in hand, clad all in glistening white.
“What on earth,” said he, “can be going on?” I
listened, and, sure enough, there was a confused
murmur of voices from the street, hurrying footsteps
on the stair, the subdued roar and tumult of mid-day.
Running to the window, I peered out, and saw
crowds of people all hurrying in the direction of
the Golden Horn. I then repaired to the hall, where
I succeeded in laying hands on a Greek waiter just
as he was shooting by me three steps at a time.
“What is it?” I said; “what has happened?”
Shaking me off, he merely cried, “Yanghen Vahr!
Heavens! did you not hear them calling?” And
then, as he disappeared, he shouted, “Look at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
top of the Galata Tower!” We ran back to the
window, and, craning our necks toward Galata, saw
the upper part of the great tower illuminated by a
brilliant red light, while a dense black cloud, issuing
from some neighboring houses amid a vortex of
flames and sparks, spread itself rapidly across the
starlit sky. Instantly our thoughts flew to those
terrible Constantinople fires of which we had heard
so much, especially that fearful one of four years
before, and for a moment we were filled with alarm
and dismay, but only for a moment&mdash;I confess it
with shame&mdash;for, following immediately upon that
first natural impulse, came the selfish eager curiosity
of the painter and writer, and a smile&mdash;yes, actually
that is the disgraceful truth, a smile&mdash;broke over our
faces which might have served as a model for one
of Doré’s demons of the infernal regions. Had any
one opened our breasts at that moment, they would
have been found to contain nothing but an inkstand
and a pallet.</p>

<p>We flung on our clothes and ran down the Grande
Rue de Pera as fast as our legs could carry us, but,
happily, our curiosity was not to be gratified on this
occasion. By the time we reached the Galata Tower
the fire had been pretty nearly extinguished; only
two small houses were actually burned; the people
were dispersing and the streets were flooded with
water from the pumps, and cluttered up with furniture
and bedding; men and women, shivering with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
fright and cold, were going about in their night-clothes,
talking and lamenting in a dozen different
languages, nothing being distinguishable through the
noise and confusion but that shrill note of terror and
excitement which marks the near escape from some
great danger. Finding that we were too late to see
anything, we walked off toward the bridge to console
ourselves for our unrighteous disappointment by
watching the sun rise, and before long we were rewarded
by a sight which went far beyond any fire.</p>

<p>The sky was just beginning to grow light beyond
the Asiatic hills; Stambul, momentarily disturbed
by the report of fire, had sunk back into the solemn
stillness of night, and banks and bridges were alike
deserted. The entire Golden Horn seemed buried
in slumber beneath a covering of light fog. Not a
boat moved, not a bird fluttered, not a tree rustled,
not a breath of wind could be heard. That huge
city, blue, hazy, silent, veiled, seemed to be an atmospheric
effect&mdash;a sudden cry, a burst of sunlight,&mdash;and
it would tremble and vanish. Never had it
appeared so aërial, so mysterious, so entirely to correspond
to the magic city of the Eastern fairy-tale
which the traveller comes upon unexpectedly, and
on entering finds every one turned to stone, just as
they were in the midst of their gay, busy lives
when the spell of a wicked genie fell upon them.
As we leaned over the bridge, gazing on the scene
before us, the fire completely forgotten, we heard all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
at once, from across the water, a faint, uncertain
noise as of persons calling aloud for help; then, as
it drew nearer, shrill cries of “Allah! Allah!
Allah!” echoing throughout the great empty space
around us, and in a moment we beheld a noisy, evil-looking
throng pouring toward us across the bridge.</p>

<p>“<i>Tulumbadgi</i>” (firemen), cried one of the bridge-guards,
and we drew to one side and watched them
as they rushed by, a horde of swarthy, half-naked
savages with bare heads and hairy chests, streaming
with perspiration, young and old, big and little, with
faces of thieves and cutthroats, four of them bearing
a small pump, that looked like a child’s bier, on
their shoulders, while the rest were armed with long
hooked poles, coils of rope, axes, and picks. On
they rushed, uttering hoarse cries, panting for
breath, with eyes dilated, streaming hair, grim, determined,
their rags fluttering in the wind and poisoning
the sweet morning air with the close, malodorous
smell of wild beasts. Sweeping across the
bridge, they finally disappeared in the Rue de
Galata, whence fainter and fainter came the cry
“Allah! Allah!” till at length profound silence
reigned once more.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey the impression made
upon my mind by this unexpected and tumultuous
irruption in the midst of the solemn, impressive
calm of the sleeping city. In an instant’s luminous
flash I saw distinctly portrayed before me scenes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of barbarian invasions, of pillage, murder, and
rape, which until then I had never been able to
picture to my mind as actual events, and I asked
myself if that could be the city that I was familiar
with&mdash;if this really were the same bridge across
which European ambassadors, ladies dressed in
Parisian costumes, and venders of French newspapers
were wont to cross by day. A moment later
and the silence of the Golden Horn was once more
broken by the same far-away cry, and another
fierce, unruly, panting mob rushed by like a whirlwind,
accompanied by the same tumult of hoarse
shouts and sinister laughter, again followed by the
mournful prolonged cry of “Allah! Allah!” which,
dying out, left us once more silent and alone. Not
long after another mob, with all the now familiar accompaniments,
poured by, and still another, then two
more, and finally the madman of Pera, stark naked
and half dead with cold, rending the air with his
piercing shrieks, and followed, as usual, by a crowd
of Turkish ragamuffins. They, like the firemen,
were swallowed up in the dark openings of the
streets on the Frankish shore, and again profound
silence fell upon the mighty city, now gilded by the
first rays of morning.</p>

<p>Before long the sun rose, and simultaneously with
it the muezzins appeared upon the various minarets;
then the käiks started into life, the harbor awoke;
people began to cross the bridge, and soon we could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
hear on all sides the dull roar of the city’s daily life
as we slowly retraced our steps toward Pera. But
so deep was the impression made upon us by that
sight&mdash;the sleeping city, the whitening heavens, the
savage hordes&mdash;that to this day we never meet without
recalling it, and always with the selfsame thrill,
half of wonder, half of fear, as though we had seen
in a vision the Stambul of other days or dreamed it
while under the mystic influence of <i>hascisc</i>.</p>

<p>And so I missed seeing a fire in Constantinople,
but if I did not actually see the one that destroyed
Pera in 1870, I have heard it described so often by
eye-witnesses, and have collected such full and accurate
details, that I may be said to have seen it with
the eyes of my mind, and, it may be, can give as
correct an account of what took place as though I
had really been present in the flesh.</p>

  <img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="600" height="429" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Turkish Firemen.</div></div>

<p>The fire started in a little house in the Rue
Feridee in Pera on the fifth day of June&mdash;that is,
in the season when the greater part of the well-to-do
population of Pera is out of town, spending the
summer in their country-houses on the Bosphorus&mdash;and
at one o’clock, just when the entire community,
European as well, is shut up in-doors taking the
mid-day siesta. The only occupant of the house in
the Rue Feridee was an old female servant&mdash;the
family having that very day gone to the country&mdash;who,
as soon as she discovered the fire, rushed into
the street and began to run, yelling “Fire!” at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
top of her lungs. People at once poured out of the
neighboring houses with buckets and little hand-pumps,
the idiotic law prohibiting persons from
extinguishing a fire until the Serasker officials have
arrived upon the scene having already fallen into
disuse, and flew of course to the nearest fountain to
have them filled. Now, the Pera fountains are only
open at certain hours of the day, when the water-carriers
who draw the supply for the families of the
vicinity can have access to them; once the distribution
is over, they are closed and locked, the keys
being placed in charge of an official with orders not
to give them up “except on receipt of a notice from
the authorities.” At this very moment there lounged
beside this particular fountain a member of the
Turkish municipal guard of Pera, with the keys in
his pocket, looking impassively on at the fire; the
crowd surrounded him, imploring him in excited
tones to unlock the fountain; but this he flatly refused
to do, on the ground that he had received no
orders to that effect. They pressed closer, grew
threatening, and finally laid forcible hands upon him,
on which he resisted, defending himself to the
best of his ability and declaring that they should
never get the key from him alive. In the mean
time the flames had made great headway; the
original house was completely destroyed, and those
next to it were burning merrily. News of the fire
had spread rapidly from quarter to quarter; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
watchmen on the summits of the Galata and Serasker
towers had hoisted the red balloons used in the day-time
as fire-signals. All the city guards were running
through the streets, striking the pavement with
their long staves and raising the dreaded cry,
“Yanghen Vahr!” (There is a fire), in response to
which was heard the hollow beating of a thousand
drums as all the barracks took the alarm. Then
three guns fired from Topkhâneh announced the
news to every quarter of the great city, from the
Black Sea to the Sea of Marmora, and at that sound
the Seraskerat, the Seraglio, the foreign embassies,
all Pera, all Galata, were thrown into an uproar, and
in a short space of time the minister of war, accompanied
by a crowd of officials, appeared in the Rue
Feridee, shortly followed by a troop of firemen eager
for the fray. But, as is almost always the case,
their first efforts proved wholly unavailing. The
narrowness of the streets interfered with their movements;
the pumps would not work; the water-supply
was both insufficient and distant, while the
undisciplined rabble of firemen found it more to
their interest to add to rather than allay the general
disorder, under cover of which they were able to
appropriate many stray pieces of property; and in
addition to everything else it was found that an
Armenian festival, which was being celebrated at
Beikos, had drawn almost all the porters thither, so
that hardly any were to be found to transport the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
contents of the burning houses to places of safety.
It must be borne in mind that wooden houses were
much more generally the rule then in Constantinople
than at present, even those whose walls were of
stone or brick being surmounted by a flimsy roof
but seldom protected by tiles, and consequently very
easily ignited. On this occasion there was not even
the advantage of a population of Mussulmans; apathetic
and fatalistic as they are, even fire does not
arouse them to any great excitement, and consequently,
although of little or no help so far as putting it out
is concerned, they at least do not interfere by their
own ill-directed efforts with what is being done by
others. Here the people were almost all Christians,
who immediately lost their heads: hardly had the
fire spread beyond the first few houses when the
entire neighborhood became a scene of the wildest,
most indescribable confusion: furniture was thrown
recklessly out of upper windows; shrieks and lamentations
rent the air; streets were blocked up, and a
general state of panic ensued, upon which neither
threats nor force availed to make the smallest
impression. Hardly one hour had elapsed from the
time when the fire first broke out before the Rue
Feridee was in flames from one end to the other.
Officials and firemen beat a hasty retreat in all
directions, sometimes abandoning the bodies of the
dead and injured in their flight, and all hope vanished
of stamping the fire out at its birth. Most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
unfortunately, a high wind was blowing, and this
carried the flames from the burning buildings in
horizontal sheets across the roofs of the neighboring
houses, like flapping tents of fire, so that they
all caught from above as though a volcano were
being discharged upon them. In this way the conflagration
spread with fearful rapidity, and many
families who were still assembled in their homes, feeling
that they were perfectly secure for some time yet,
and would be able to remove at least a part of their
belongings, were first made aware of their danger
by having the roof fall in, and barely had time to
escape with their lives. House after house caught
as though smeared with pitch, and instantly out of
each of the innumerable little windows there poured
a torrent of flame, long winding sheets, curling and
swaying from side to side like great fiery serpents
hungry for their prey, reaching down and licking the
very stones as though in search of human victims.
The fire did not seem to run, but rather fly, and, instead
of enveloping the objects in its path, flowed
over them like an angry tide. From the Rue
Feridee it swept furiously down the Rue Tarla-Bashi,
then turned back to pour like a torrent
through the Rue de Misc and enfold the entire
quarter of Agha-Dgiami as though it had been a
forest of dead trees; then the Rue Sakes-Agatshe,
then that of Kalindgi-Kuluk, and then street after
street with terrifying rapidity until the entire incline<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of Yeni-Sheir was wrapped in flames; and these met
and mingled with the blazing whirlwind which swept,
roaring and bellowing, down the Grande Rue de
Pera. It was not even as though there had been a
thousand disconnected fires to extinguish, a thousand
disorganized enemies to vanquish, but rather
as though each fresh conflagration were the well-aimed
stroke of some master mind controlling and
directing all his forces, and having no less object in
view than the destruction of the entire city, not one
corner of which was to be allowed to escape. The
narrow streets were like so many streams of lava,
which would meet and swell into rivers or suddenly
spread out into fiery lakes, utterly incapable of being
stopped or controlled by any one. At the end of
three hours half of Pera was in flames; a thousand
columns of smoke, red, blue, white, and black,
swept over the houses, lightly grazing the roofs, and
extending as far as the eye could reach along the
hillsides, obscuring and transforming with sinister
effect the vast outskirts on the Golden Horn. In all
directions could be seen furious whirlwinds of cinders
and sparks, while against the houses still standing
in the lower quarters of the city the wind beat
showers of sparks and bits of charred wood, blowing
them about like so much hail. In the burning quarters
the streets were simply nothing less than huge
furnaces, covered on top with a thick awning of
solid flame, and constantly fed with pine wood from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the Black Sea used for beams, the light inflammable
rafters of <i>ciardak</i>, balconies and wooden minarets
from the smaller mosques, all of which, falling
in with a crackling, splintering noise, sounded as
though they were being torn in pieces by an earthquake.
Down those streets which were still passable
flying forms were seen of mounted lancers, illuminated
by what might have been the light of the infernal
regions, as they galloped furiously in all directions,
carrying the orders of the Seraskerat;
Seraglio officials with bare heads and faces blackened
with smoke; stray horses whose riders had met with
some accident; files of porters laden with all manner
of household goods; troops of howling dogs;
gangs of homeless fugitives stumbling and falling in
their mad flight down the steep inclines, blindly
treading down the dead and injured, scaling the
heaps of débris, and disappearing finally amid fire
and smoke like legions of the damned. Once, at
the opening of a burning street, the mounted figure
of Sultan Abdul-Aziz appeared for an instant, surrounded
by his court, pale as a ghost, staring with
dilated eyes at the flames, as though repeating to
himself the memorable words of Selim I.: “This is
the fiery breath of my victims destined to consume
my capital, my seraglio, my very self!” A moment
later he had disappeared amid a cloud of smoke and
cinders, followed by his courtiers.</p>

<div id="if_i_6" class="figcenter" style="width: 502px;">
  <img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="502" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Water Seller.</div></div>

<p>All of the army stationed at Constantinople, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
addition to the innumerable brigades of firemen,
were pressed into service, being formed into long
chains and immense semicircles, which, under the
direction of the viziers, officials of the court, pashas,
and ulemas, endeavored to surround whole quarters,
or, by concentrating their efforts upon some special
spot, check the advance of the fire in that direction.
Row after row of buildings would fall in the space
of a few minutes; the roofs swarmed with intrepid
men waging the unequal conflict at close quarters,
and ever and anon falling into the yawning crater
at their feet, only to be succeeded by others, as
when some daring attack is making upon a powerful
enemy, sending up hoarse cries and waving their
singed fezzes in the midst of the smoke and flames.
But, notwithstanding all these efforts, the fire still
advanced triumphant, lit up the thousand streams
of water directed against it, and leaped at a bound
across the gardens, open squares, small cemeteries,
and great stone buildings which lay in its path, forcing
back soldiers, firemen, and citizens on all sides,
like an army in retreat, and beating them about the
shoulders as with red-hot muskets. Yet even in
all that frightful panic and confusion there were
those who preserved their self-possession sufficiently
to perform noble acts of heroism and devotion.
White-veiled Sisters of Charity could be seen
in the midst of blazing ruins leaning over the prostrate
forms of the dying; Turks threw themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
into the flames and reappeared bearing in their
scorched and blackened arms the bodies of Christian
children; other Mussulmans were known to have
stood, apparently unmoved, with folded arms watching
a burning house, and, while the families of
Christians around them, utterly beside themselves
with fright, filled the air with useless lamentations,
would coldly offer a reward of a hundred Turkish
francs to any one who would rescue a European boy
who had failed to escape with the rest; and others,
again, who made it their business to look after the
injured children whom they found in the streets,
binding up their wounds with strips torn from their
own turbans, and seeing that they were restored to
their parents; and still others who generously threw
open their doors to the half-naked fugitives; while
more than one was seen to set an example of courage
and indifference to the things of this world by
seating himself upon a rug in front of his burning
domicile, calmly smoking a narghileh, and only moving
farther off as the flames advanced.</p>

<p>But neither courage nor indifference, real or
assumed, availed to check that fiery tempest. Now
and then, with some temporary dying down of the
wind, it would seem to abate a little of its fury, but
not for long: the wind rising again with renewed violence,
the flames, which had hardly begun to subside,
would burst forth afresh, shooting out their sharp
points like well-directed arrows, and accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
by a deep, rumbling roar, broken from time to time
by sharp explosions from the petroleum shops or gas
in the dwellings, where the pipes were transformed
into streams of molten lead; or when roofs would suddenly
fall as though borne down by an avalanche;
or a grove of cypress trees all at once begin to twist
and writhe, and then burst into flame, sending down
showers of burning resin; or some group of old
wooden houses explode simultaneously like rockets,
and emit such a fury of flame that it would seem
as though the bellows of a thousand workshops were
being turned upon them. It was a scene of ruin and
wholesale destruction and disaster such as might result
from fire, flood, earthquake, and the sacking of
the city by a victorious army, all going on at once.
No one had ever seen or imagined such horrors, and
the effect upon the whole population was as though
it had gone stark mad. In the streets of Pera the
wildest confusion reigned, such noise and panic as
are found on the deck of a vessel about to founder.
There, in the midst of heaps of overturned furniture,
beneath the flashing blades of the officers’
swords, the knocks and blows of porters and water-carriers,
the hoofs of the pashas’ horses, gangs of
firemen advancing at a dead run, overturning and
treading down all they came in contact with,&mdash;were
French, Italian, Greek, and Armenian families, rich
and poor, old and young, men, women, and children,
lost, distraught, groping blindly about in search of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
missing relatives, filling the air with shrieks and
lamentations, choked with smoke and blinded with
sparks; or a foreign ambassador followed by a troop
of servants laden with books and valuable documents;
or monks holding the crucifix aloft above
the heads of the terrified throng; groups of Turkish
women, their arms filled with costly objects from
the harem; processions of men bending beneath the
spoils of mosque and school, church or theatre; and
from time to time a suffocating cloud of smoke,
blown down by some sudden gust, would wrap
everything in temporary darkness and increase still
more the general terror and confusion.</p>

<p>An added feature of the horrors of that fearful
time were the armies of thieves and desperadoes,
who, having assembled, in obedience to some secret
code of signals in use among them, from every hole
and den in Constantinople, arrayed themselves in
the guise of porters, soldiers, or respectable citizens,
and then, boldly entering houses on pretence of
lending assistance, made off with armsful of plunder:
sometimes these gentry, being detected, would
be pursued as they fled with their booty to Kassim
Pasha or Tataola by parties of soldiers, and on being
overtaken and surrounded pitched battles would
ensue.</p>

<p>Firemen, porters, and water-carriers, reinforced
by their numerous families and relatives, organized
into bands, and before the very eyes of the distracted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
owners would all at once strike for higher wages,
utterly declining to go on working unless their pay
were doubled or quadrupled. Furniture and household
goods heaped in the narrow streets and guarded
by the families who owned them would be captured
by crews of armed plunderers, the owners driven
away, and the defences strengthened to afford resistance
against other bands of blackguards. Troops
of fugitives escaping with some of their personal
property, encountering similar parties in some narrow
thoroughfare, would dispute the right of way fiercely,
desperately, abandoning in their mad flight those
who were overthrown or injured in the onslaught.</p>

<p>But by the time the fire had raged for four hours
it had gained such headway that few gave further
thought to their property: to escape alive was the
most that could be hoped for; two-thirds of Pera
were in flames, and the fire had now reached such
volume, and was advancing in so many different
directions at once, that a whole quarter would
suddenly be surrounded and cut off by a girdle of
flame before the inhabitants had become aware of
its approach. Hundreds of terrified creatures,
flying in disorder up some narrow, steep, winding
street, intent only on escaping from the hungry
fiend in their rear, would at some sudden turn be
confronted by a whirlwind of smoke and flame
bearing relentlessly down upon them, and turn
shrieking back to seek wildly for some other road<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
of escape; entire families, one numbering twenty-two
persons, were all at once surrounded, suffocated,
burned, charred; some, beside themselves with terror,
would take refuge in cellars, where they were soon
choked to death; others threw themselves into wells
and cisterns, climbed trees, or, after searching vainly
through their houses for some spot or corner where
they might hope for protection, suddenly losing their
heads, would be seen to rush out and fling themselves
voluntarily into the flames. Looking down
the hillsides of Pera from some high point, families
could be seen assembled upon their roofs, who,
kneeling in close groups and with outstretched arms
in the centre of an ever-narrowing circle of flame,
invoked that aid from Heaven which man was
powerless to give; herds of frantic people, rushing
from the heights of Pera to scatter themselves
throughout Galata, Topkhâneh, Fundukli, and the
cemeteries in the lower parts of the town, ever
running farther and farther, looking for still more
distant and protected spots in which to hide themselves
from the enemy, whom they imagined to be
still pursuing them; children streaming with blood;
wild-looking women, with singed hair and torn flesh,
bearing dead or dying infants in their arms; men
with faces and limbs frightfully burned, who writhed
on the ground in their agony; old people sobbing
like children; men of wealth reduced in the course
of a few moments to penury, who beat their heads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
against the stones; youths yelling like maniacs, who
fell unconscious on the banks of the Golden Horn,
spent with excitement and horror; families bearing
the blackened corpses of their dead; poor creatures,
driven crazy by the sights around them, who hurried
along dragging chairs after them attached to strings,
or clasped bits of rags or broken pottery to their
bosoms as though they were of priceless value, at
the same time giving vent to loud lamentations or
bursts of insane laughter.</p>

<p>And still from the lower quarters of Galata, from
the arsenals of Tersane and Topkhâneh, from barrack,
mosque, and imperial palace, there swarmed
fresh battalions of <i>nizam</i>, crews of robbers,
bands of firemen, shouting “<i>Yanghen Vahr</i>” or
“<i>Allah</i>,” advancing as to an attack, scaling the hills
under the steady rain of sparks and cinders and
burning brands, and through streets filled with
smouldering débris, and with them generals, dervishes,
messengers from the court, families who had
turned back to search for missing members, blackguards
and heroes, misery, crime, and charity,&mdash;all
mingled together in a confused, inextricable torrent
which swept through the narrow streets with a roar
like that of the ocean in a storm, its surface lighted
up with the crimson glare of that mighty furnace.</p>

<p>And just across from this region of torment lay
Stambul, peaceful, smiling, and serene as ever,
while on the other side the tranquil beauties of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Asiatic shore were mirrored in the waters of the
Bosphorus, on whose unmoved bosom the ships rode
peacefully at anchor. Enormous crowds of people,
blackening the banks for miles, stood silent and
impassive witnesses of the horrible sight; the sing-song
voice of the muezzin was heard as usual announcing
from every minaret the setting of the sun;
flocks of birds soared lazily above the mosques on
the Seven Hills; and venerable Turks, seated in
the shade of plane trees on the verdant heights
of Skutari, murmured placidly to themselves,
“And so the final hour of the City of the Sultans
has sounded? That day which was foretold has
come: let Allah’s will be done.&mdash;So be it, so be it!”</p>

<p>Happily, with nightfall came the beginning of
the end. At seven o’clock the last building took
fire&mdash;the English embassy&mdash;and just after that, the
wind suddenly dying down, the fire was either
extinguished or went out of its own accord. It had
been burning six hours, and in that time two-thirds
of Pera were reduced to ashes, nine thousand houses
destroyed, and two thousand lives lost.</p>

<p>Next to the famous fire of 1756, which demolished,
in the reign of Osman III. eighty thousand houses and
wiped out two-thirds of Stambul, no such disaster as
this has ever visited the city, nor from the time Constantinople
was conquered up to the present day has
any one fire been the cause of so much loss of life.</p>

<p>On the following day Pera presented a spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
which, if less terrifying, was in no sense less heart*-rending,
than that during the actual progress of the
fire. Wherever the flames had passed there was
nothing to be seen but grim wastes broken only by
the naked outlines of great hills; unfamiliar views
were opened up; broad sheets of light poured down
upon vast open spaces covered with ashes, while here
and there the melancholy column of a blackened and
half-ruined chimney stood like a gravestone marking
the site of a desolated hearth. Whole quarters had
disappeared as completely as though they had been
Bedouin encampments swept away by a cyclone.
Through many streets, which could only be traced by
the double line of black, smoking ruins, thousands
of the homeless wandered up and down, ragged and
dishevelled, imploring aid from the hurrying throng
of soldiers and doctors, Sisters of Charity, and priests
of every religion, while employés of all ranks distributed
the food and money or directed the placing
of the mattresses, bedding, and army tents issued by
order of the government for the use of the entirely
destitute. The heights of Tataola and the great
Armenian cemetery swarmed with dense crowds of
persons formed into a huge encampment; everywhere
one stumbled upon piles of household goods, whose
owners, utterly exhausted with what they had been
through, lay stretched out upon them. The vast
Galata cemetery looked like a bazâr which had been
turned upside down: piled along the walks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
among the tombs was a bewildering mass of household
stuff&mdash;divans, pillows, bedding, pianos, books,
pictures, broken carriages; the gilded sedan chair of
an ambassadress; parrot-cages out of the harems; and
horses who had sustained injuries tied to the cypress
trees,&mdash;all watched over by porters and servants
blackened with smoke and dropping with fatigue.
The dregs and offscourings of the city employed
themselves in searching through the ruins for stray
valuables, locks off the doors, nails, and bits of iron,
avoiding the outstretched forms of soldiers and firemen,
who, unable to hold out any longer against sleep
and fatigue, had dropped wherever they might
happen to be. Here and there persons might be
seen endeavoring by the aid of pieces of board and
strips of canvas to erect temporary places of shelter
above their ruined dwellings; groups of people
kneeling before the blackened altar of some roofless
church; and men and women passing in review the
long lines of charred and disfigured bodies, who,
finally recognizing in some pitiful blackened heap
the object of their search, would burst into shuddering
sobs and wails of despair, while others would suddenly
be seen to drop as though they had been shot
from their places in some long procession of biers and
litters; and over all clouds of dust and smoke and
the dense, suffocating atmosphere heavy with the
sickening smell of charred human flesh. Now and
then the men working with picks and shovels among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the ruins would dislodge showers of ashes and cinders
upon the close, silent, awe-stricken crowds collected
from all parts of Stambul, above whose heads would
appear groups of consuls and ambassadors, drawn
up at the corners of the streets and gazing in pale-faced
consternation at the surrounding ruin.</p>

<p>And yet, overpowering as this disaster appeared
at the time, as is always the case in Oriental countries,
not many months had elapsed before it was
completely forgotten. When I visited Constantinople
four years later no traces of it were to be seen except
certain tracts of bare ground at the far end of
Pera, below the heights of Tataola, and the fire was
referred to by the inhabitants as something which
had occurred in the remote past. For some little
time&mdash;that is, as long as the ruins were still warm&mdash;the
papers were filled with demands that the government
should be made to take some precautions
against a recurrence of the same thing. They suggested
the reorganization of the fire department, the
purchase of new pumps, increase of the water-supply,
and that regulations should be enacted controlling
the manner in which houses were to be built
in the future; but, finding that the government
turned a deaf ear to these proposals, the Europeans
soon ceased to make them, and continued to live in
the Turkish fashion; that is, trusting a little to the
good God and a little to good luck.</p>

<p>And so, as nothing or next to nothing has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
done to improve the conditions, we may assume
pretty confidently that the fire of 1870 was not the
last of those great conflagrations which, “it is written,”
are in the course of every few years or so to
devastate the City of the Sultans. It is true that
many of the houses in Pera are now built of masonry,
but most of these are wretchedly constructed
by architects without either knowledge or experience,
sometimes by any one who happens to
come along; and, the authorities not attempting to
exercise any sort of supervision in the matter, it is
not unusual for them to fall down before being completed,
while those which remain standing are not in
any way fitted to resist fire. Water, too, is always
scarce, especially in Pera, and is everywhere subjected
to the most shameful monopoly, and, being
mainly derived from the reservoirs built by the
Romans in the village of Belgrâd, the supply
fails altogether unless abundant rains fall in both
spring and autumn; then the rich pay its weight in
gold to get it, while the poor people drink mud.
The fire-brigade might be likened more to an army
of malefactors than an organized corps of employés:
it is composed of men of every nationality,
accountable, more in name than in actual fact, to the
Seraskerat, from which they receive nothing but a
ration of bread&mdash;untaught, undisciplined, dishonest,
feared and dreaded by the people quite as much as
the flames which they do not know how to extinguish,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and suspected, not without cause, of hoping for fires
as affording opportunities for pillage. As for the
pumps, while there seems to be plenty of them, and
the Turks pride themselves upon these wonderful
machines, they are in reality absurd playthings,
holding about a dozen quarts of water, which they
throw out in gentle little rivulets more suitable for
watering flower-beds than extinguishing fires.</p>

<p>And yet the inhabitants of Constantinople might
consider themselves fortunate were these the only
evils existing in this connection. There is
doubtless no foundation for the reports&mdash;credited,
however, by some&mdash;that the government instigates
many of the fires with a view to widening
the streets: the dangers and inconveniences of such
a method would be too great in comparison with the
advantages; nor does it now happen, as it has sometimes
in the past, that the “opposition” sets fire to
a certain quarter in order to intimidate the sultans,
or the army to enforce its demands for higher pay;
but the general suspicion that many fires are started
deliberately by persons who have something to gain
thereby has but too often been verified, and hence
the people of Constantinople live in a continual state
of dread. They are afraid of the water-carriers,
porters, architects, lumber- and lime-merchants, and,
more than all the rest, of their servants, who are the
evil geniuses of Constantinople: these people are
all in league with organized bands of thieves, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in turn being in communication with various other
secret organizations which manage the sale of every
kind of stolen property and facilitate the commission
of all manner of crimes, while the local police treat
them all alike with a leniency which savors strongly
of complicity. No incendiary was ever known to be
punished, and thieves are rarely arraigned after a
fire; more rarely still are the stolen goods restored
to their rightful owners. Moreover, Constantinople
being a rendezvous for miscreants from all over the
world, the course of justice is constantly being
blocked by international complications: consuls demand
the surrender of criminals of their own countries;
trials drag on for centuries; and so many delinquents
escape altogether that the fear of punishment
as a restraining influence upon the criminal
class is almost <i>nil</i>, and they have come to look upon
the plundering of houses during a fire much in the
light of a privilege tacitly acknowledged by the
authorities to be theirs, just as soldiers were formerly
allowed to sack and plunder a vanquished
city. And so the word “Fire” still means for the
inhabitants of Constantinople “every misfortune,”
and the cry <i>Yanghen Vahr</i> is charged with a dread
meaning, terrible, fateful, carrying with it dismay&mdash;a
cry at which the entire city is moved to its very
depths, and pours forth as at the announcement of a
scourge from God. And who can tell how often yet
the great metropolis is doomed to fall before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
flames and rise again ere European civilization shall
have planted its triumphant ensign upon the imperial
palace of Dolmabâghcheh?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the old days, when a fire broke out in Constantinople,
if the Sultan happened to be at that moment
in the harem, news of the disaster was sent to him
in the person of an odalisque dressed in scarlet from
head to foot, with orders to present herself before
him wherever he might be, were it even in the
embraces of the favorite. She had only to appear
upon the threshold: the flaming color of her attire
would do the rest and be the mute announcement of
her errand. Will any one believe that among all
the striking and terrible pictures which my mind
conjures up at the thought of a Constantinople fire
the figure of that odalisque moves my artistic sense
the most, and makes me long to be a painter that I
might depict the scene as it rises before me? At all
events, I shall go on begging every artist I meet to
do it for me, until I come across one whose fancy
will be struck with the idea, and who will earn my
undying gratitude. The picture will represent an
apartment in the imperial harem flooded with soft
light. Seated upon a broad divan by the side of a
fair young pearl-bedecked Circassian, Selim I., the
mighty Sultan, suddenly disengages himself from the
arms of his companion, and fixes his great black
eyes upon the scarlet-clad odalisque standing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
doorway, mute, erect, immovable as a statue, one
hand holding back the curtain beyond which is seen
the open terrace, and in the blue distance the great
smoking city, while her pallid, terror-stricken face
would seem to say, “King of kings, Allah summons
you to go to the relief of your unhappy people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_102">102</a><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
I determined to make the circuit of the ancient
walls of Stambul entirely alone, and this plan I recommend
to all Italians visiting Constantinople, as
the sight of those majestic and beautiful ruins cannot
make a profound and lasting impression upon
the mind unless one is altogether intent upon receiving
it and can freely follow his own train of thought.
It is a question of tramping about fifteen Italian
miles through deserted streets and exposed to the
full blaze of the sun. “Very possibly,” said I to
my friend, “when I have gone halfway I shall be
seized with such a desperate attack of loneliness
that I will invoke you like one of the saints, but, all
the same, I want to go by myself.” And so, having
first lightened my purse for fear some suburban pick-pocket
might do it for me, and thrown something to
the “eager dogs within,” so that I might say to
myself later on, “Be still, then, accursed wolf!”
I set forth in the direction of the Validêh Sultan
bridge at eight in the morning, beneath a sky washed
clean and bright by a shower which had fallen during
the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
My plan was to leave Stambul by the gate in the
Blachernæ, to follow the line of the walls from the
Golden Horn to the Castle of the Seven Towers, and
to return along the shore of the Sea of Marmora,
thus completing the triangle of the Mussulman city.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge, I turned to the right and
plunged into that vast district known as <i>Istambul
disciaré</i>, or Outer Stambul, a long strip of the city
shut in between the walls and the harbor, composed
of miserable little houses and wood and oil-shops,
and more than once destroyed by fire; flights of
stairs lead from the banks down to little inlets
crowded with boats and shipping, and in the space
between these on the one hand, and the narrow lanes
and alleyways of the city on the other, there is a
constant passing back and forth of porters, asses,
and camels, the same mixture of strange people and
dirty things which, as well as the unintelligible
clamor of tongues, is to be found in those wonderful
ports of the Chinese and Indian seas where the
people and merchandise of two hemispheres meet
and mingle. Those walls which are still standing
on this side are five times a man’s height, castellated,
strengthened every hundred paces by small quadrangular
towers, and in many places falling into
ruins. They are, from an historic or artistic standpoint,
however, the least noteworthy of any of the
fortifications of Stambul.</p>

<p>Traversing the Greek quarters, I skirted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
bank among the various pastry-cook, fruit, and
fritter stalls, passing by groups of handsome Greek
sailors standing in the attitudes of their own ancient
gods around some cook carrying on his avocation in
the open; then, making a circuit around the vast
Ghetto of Balata and threading the silent Blachernæ
quarter, I finally quitted the city by the gate called
<i>Egri Kapou</i>, not far from the banks of the Golden
Horn. While all this may be said in a few words,
to do it requires an hour and a half, now mounting,
now descending, passing around lakes of mud and
over heaps of stones, through an endless maze of
narrow streets and dark passage-ways, across vast
desolate wastes, with nothing to guide you but the
points on the minarets of the Selim mosque: at a
certain place you begin to notice fewer and fewer
European faces and costumes; then European houses
disappear, then pavements, then the signs on the
shops, then names on the streets, then every indication
of labor; and the farther you go the more surly
the dogs become, the more impudently do the Turkish
ragamuffins stare you in the eye, and the common
women take pains to conceal their faces; until at
last you find yourself in the heart of barbarous Asia,
and, instead of a two hours’ walk, you seem to have
made a two days’ journey.</p>

<p>On issuing from the <i>Egri Kapou</i> I turned to the
left, and came quite unexpectedly upon a long stretch
of those famous walls which formed Stambul’s defences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
upon the land side. Three years have elapsed
since that moment, but to this day I can never recall
it without a fresh sensation of wonder. There is no
other spot in the East, so far as I know, which presents
so vividly before the mind the memories of
the past, the grandeur of human achievement, the
majesty of power, the glory of the centuries, the mystery
of decay, and the beauties of nature. You are
filled with awe and terror and admiration at this
sight, worthy of a canto of Homer, and involuntarily
uncover, exclaiming “All honor!” as though called
upon to salute the mutilated ranks of some mighty
band of heroes.</p>

<p>The line of walls and lofty towers extends as far
as the eye can reach, rising and falling according to
the natural character of the land, at some points
seeming to sink into the earth, and at others to
crown the summit of a mountain: it is diversified
by an endless variety of color, and ruin in every
stage of advancement, in some places nearly black,
in others almost as yellow as gold, and overgrown
by a rich, deep-green vegetation, which, scaling the
walls to their very summits, falls back in waving
garlands from the battlements and loopholes, rears
itself in feathery plumes upon the tops of the towers,
and overflows in green cascades from curtain and
crumbling breach, its billowy waves filling the moat
and lapping the very roadside.</p>

<p>There are three lines of fortifications, forming as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
it were three gigantic ruined steps. The inner one,
which is the highest, is strengthened at short regular
intervals by massive square towers; that in the middle
by round ones; the outer wall, much lower than
the others, is protected by a deep, wide moat, formerly
filled with water drawn from the Golden Horn
and Sea of Marmora, and now choked with grass
and shrubbery. These walls, as we see them now,
are almost precisely as they were the day after the
conquest of Constantinople. The restorations made
by Muhammad and Bayezid II. amount to very little.
There can be still seen the breaches made by Orbano’s
powerful guns, the marks left by the catapults
and battering-rams, the great rents where
mines were fired, and all the various indications
which mark those spots where the attack was most
furious, the defence most desperate. Almost all the
round towers of the middle wall are ruined from base
to summit, and while those of the inner wall are
most of them still standing, they are broken at the
corners, dismantled, dwindling off to points at the
top, like huge tree-trunks sharpened at the end with
blows from some giant axe, or else cracked from top
to bottom or hollowed out at the base like cliffs
worn by the sea-waves. Great masses of masonry
detached from the curtains have rolled down upon the
platforms of the middle and outer walls and choke
up the moat. Little footpaths wind in and out
amid the heaps of stones and thick underbrush, lost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
to view in the deep shadows of the overhanging
vegetation between huge stones and bare patches of
earth torn up by the falling of some heavy mass.
Each portion of walls between any two towers comprises
in itself a complete and wonderful example
of ruins and of vegetation, full of power and majesty,
wild, colossal, forbidding, and adorned with a
melancholy and imposing beauty which impels a
feeling of reverence. One seems to be looking at
the ruins of an endless chain of feudal castles, or
of one of those mighty girdles of wall which encircled
the fabulous empires of Eastern Asia. Constantinople
of to-day disappears, and before us rises
the City of the Constantines; we breathe the air of
the fifteenth century, and as our thoughts become
more and more centred upon the day of her tremendous
fall, we find ourselves for a few moments
dazed, bewildered, and turned, as it were, to stone.</p>

<p>The Egri Kapou through which I had come is
identical with the famous Charsian gate used by
Justinian when he made his triumphal entry into the
city, and later by Alexius Comnenus when he seized
the throne: before it lies a Mussulman cemetery,
and here, during the early days of the siege, were
placed the gigantic cannon of Orbano, which kept
four hundred artillerymen employed and required a
hundred oxen to move. The gate was defended by
Teodoro di Caristo and Giovanni Greant against
the attacks of the left wing of the Turkish army,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
which reached clear to the Golden Horn. From this
point to the Sea of Marmora there are no longer any
hamlets, not so much as a group of houses, and, as
the road consequently runs between the walls and
the open country, there is nothing whatever to distract
one’s thoughts from the mighty ruins themselves.
Setting forth on the road, I walked for some
time between two cemeteries, a Christian one on my
left, lying directly beneath the walls, and an enormous
Mussulman one on my right, shaded by a forest
of cypress trees; overhead the sun poured down in
straight, direct rays; before me stretched the highway,
white, solitary, and rising by a gentle incline,
until on the summit of the opposite heights it divided
the limpid horizon with a sharp, clear-cut line. On
one hand tower succeeded tower, on the other tombstone
followed tombstone; not a sound broke the
stillness save my own measured tread and the occasional
rustle of a lizard in the grass by the roadside.
After walking thus for some distance, I suddenly
found myself opposite a beautiful square gateway
surmounted by a great arch in an excellent state of
preservation, and flanked by two massive octagonal
towers. This was the Adrianopolis Gate, the Polyandrion
of the Greeks, which was made the principal
point of attack when the Avars besieged Constantinople
during the reign of Heraclius in 625. During
the attack under Muhammad II. it was defended by
the brothers Paoli and Antonino Troilo Bochiardi, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
later on was the gate through which the Turks made
their victorious exits and entries. Neither ahead
nor about me was there a living soul to be seen:
all at once a couple of Turkish cavalrymen came
through the gate and disappeared down the Adrianopolis
road at a full gallop, enveloped in a thick
cloud of dust, after which everything returned to
the same death-like stillness. Following their lead,
I too took the Adrianopolis road, and, turning my
back for a time upon the walls, descended into the
valley of the Lycus, climbed the opposite ascent, and
found myself looking out over the vast undulating
and arid plain of Dahud-Pasha, where, during the
siege of Constantinople, Muhammad II. established
his head-quarters. Here I stood for some time,
shading my eyes with my hand and searching about
as if expecting to find some traces still of the imperial
camp to aid me in picturing to myself the
strange and imposing spectacle which that spot must
have presented toward the close of the spring of 1453.
Just here the life of all that mighty army flowed
back as to its heart, clasping in its fatal embrace
the great dying metropolis; from this point those
orders were issued which fell on all sides like thunderbolts,
set in motion the arms of a hundred thousand
workmen, directed the overland transportation
of two hundred galleys<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> from the Bay of Beshiktash
to the bay of Kassim-Pasha, thrust armies of Armenian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
miners into the bowels of the earth, despatched
heralds in all directions whose flags announced the
hour of attack, and in the time it would take to tell
the beads of a tespi bent three hundred thousand bows
and caused three hundred thousand cimeters to flash
in the air. Here the trembling envoys of Constantine
came face to face with their Genoese countrymen
from Galata selling oil with which to grease
Orbano’s mighty cannon, and Mussulman scouts
stationed upon the banks of the Sea of Marmora in
order that they might give warning when the
European fleet should appear upon the horizon
bringing the last relief of Christianity to the last
defences of the Constantines. There too were to be
found a swarm of renegade Christians, Asiatic adventurers,
old sheikhs, and lean, ragged dervishes,
wasted away by long marches, going restlessly
back and forth among the tents of the fourteen
thousand Janissaries; and interminable troops of
horse already harnessed, long files of camels standing
motionless in the midst of catapults and battering-rams,
and cannons lying overturned where they
had exploded, and great pyramids of huge granite
balls, among which wound long processions of begrimed
and blackened soldiers bearing two by two
from the neighborhood of the walls to the open
country beyond the mutilated bodies of the dead and
groaning forms of the wounded; while over all there
hung a perpetual cloud of smoke.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>In the centre of the Janissaries’ camp rose the
many-colored tents of the court, and high above
them all the crimson pavilion of Muhammad II.
At daybreak he would appear in his doorway pale
from the anxious vigil of the night, wearing a great
turban to which was affixed a yellow plume, and a
long blood-colored caftan. There he would stand,
his eagle glance fixed upon the still unconquered
city lying before him, one hand toying with his
thick black beard, while with the other he fingered
uneasily the silver handle of his curved dagger:
around him would be gathered a group of his
officers&mdash;Orbano, inventor of that huge cannon
which was destined before many days to explode
and scatter his own bones upon the esplanade of
the Hippodrome; Admiral Balta-Ogli, already filled
with uneasy presentiments concerning his future and
the disgrace which the golden sceptre of his mighty
lord was to bring about his ears; the hardy governor
of the Epepolin, that great movable castle, surmounted
by a tower and braced with iron, which
was finally burned to the ground in front of the gate
of San Romano; and a circle of poets and legislators
bronzed by the suns of a hundred battlefields; a
retinue of pashas, whose bodies were covered with
wounds and their long caftans riddled with arrow-holes;
a throng of gigantic Janissaries, with naked
blades clasped in their hands, and sciaus armed with
great steel clubs, ready to strike off the head or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
pound the flesh of rebel or coward alike; the flower
of that boundless multitude of Asiatics, overflowing
with youth, energy, and ferocity, only awaiting
the signal to hurl themselves like a mighty torrent
of fire and sword upon the feeble remnant of the
Byzantine Empire. There they would stand, silent,
motionless, in the rosy beams of the rising sun, looking
with rapt gaze where, against the horizon, the
thousand cupolas of the great city promised to them
by the Prophet rose above the sobs and lamentations
of its cowardly inhabitants. I saw them thus before
me, their very postures, their arms, the folds of their
long cloaks and caftans, their gigantic shadows falling
athwart the earth seamed and scarred with the
passage of heavy cannon and ponderous cars, when
all at once, my eye chancing to fall upon a large
stone half buried in the ground, I mechanically read
the worn inscription upon its face. In a twinkling
the imposing warlike scene disappeared, and in its
stead the wide barren plain was peopled with a light-hearted
multitude of Vincennes soldiers in their red
breeches; I heard the cheerful songs of Normandy
and Provence, saw Maréchal Saint-Arnaud, Canrobert,
Forey, Espinasse, Pelissier, and recognized a
thousand faces and brilliant uniforms, alive in my
memory and dear to my heart ever since childhood,
and read again, with an inexpressible sensation of
surprise and delight, that meagre inscription: “Eugène
Saccard, Caporal dans le 22° léger, 16 Juin, 1854.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
From this point I recrossed the valley of the
Lycus, and again took the road which skirts the
walls, still lonely and deserted and still winding between
ruins and cemeteries, passing before the ancient
military Gate of Pempti, now walled up, and again
crossing the Lycus, which enters the city at this
point, I found myself in front of the Cannon Gate,
so called from the circumstance of Orbano’s great
gun having been stationed opposite it; here Muhammad II.
made his last and successful assault upon the
fortifications. Raising my eyes to the top of the
wall, I was startled at encountering the gaze of two
or three dark, unprepossessing-looking individuals
with wild, matted hair, who peered down at me from
behind the battlements with an expression of astonishment,
and then remembered to have heard that a
band of gypsies had established themselves in the
ruined towers and more habitable parts of the fortification.
The traces left at this point of the fearful
conflict are grand and awe-inspiring beyond expression&mdash;crumbling,
dismantled walls, towers knocked
to pieces or battered out of shape, bastions buried
beneath huge masses of rubbish, loopholes burst open,
the earth ploughed up, and the moat filled with
colossal fragments which look like masses detached
from the side of a rugged mountain. It is as though
the terrific battle had been waged only the preceding
day, and these ruins speak more eloquently than
could any human voice of the frightful disaster of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
which they are the witnesses. It was the same,
with but slight modification, before every gate in the
whole line of the defences. The battle began at
daybreak, with the Ottoman forces divided into four
enormous columns preceded by a hundred thousand
volunteers, who formed an immense vanguard predestined
to death. All of this food for the cannon,
this reckless, undisciplined horde of Tartars, Caucasians,
Arabs, and negroes, directed by sheikhs spurred
on by dervishes, driven and lashed from behind by
furious bands of sciaus, hurled itself forward to the
attack laden with earth and faggots, forming one
unbroken line and raising one unearthly yell from
the Sea of Marmora to the Golden Horn. On reaching
the edge of the moat they are momentarily
checked by a hailstorm of stone and iron missiles,
beating hundreds upon hundreds to the ground,
pierced with arrows, blown to pieces by the cannonballs,
set fire to by <i>springals</i>, beaten, crushed, and
torn asunder&mdash;old men, boys, slaves, thieves, shepherds,
brigands, hewn down by the thousand, until
before long the moat and banks are filled with dead
bodies, heaps of quivering flesh, blood-stained turbans,
bows, and cimeters, across which still other
hordes, driven forward by those behind, rush to the
attack, only to be beaten back, overturned, repulsed,
decimated by a still more furious storm of stones
and arrows from the walls; while a dense cloud of
smoke and dust envelops alike besiegers and besieged,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
living and dead, until at length a shrill, wild
call from a thousand Ottoman trumpets, heard above
the din of battle, sounds the retreat, and the great
vanguard, bleeding, exhausted, and reduced to half
its number, draws off from the entire length of the
walls in an unsteady, wavering line. Then Muhammad
gives the signal for a general assault, and at
that sign three mighty armies, three great rivers of
men, start into motion, advance, spread out, cover
the heights, overflow the valleys, and amid the flashing
of swords and waving of banners, the din and
clangor of drums and trumpets, sweep against those
doomed walls with a shock like that of a tempestuous
ocean beating against a rock-bound shore, while the
savage cry, uttered as with one voice from all that
vast multitude of powerful throats, “<i>La Ilah illa
lah!</i>” echoes like a thunder-clap from the Golden
Horn to the Castle of the Seven Towers. Then the
great battle really begins, or rather a hundred different
battles, carried on before every gate, at every
breach, in the ditches, from the bastions, at the foot
of the curtains. From one end to the other of Constantinople’s
mighty ramparts ten thousand bastions
pour down death and destruction upon two hundred
thousand human beings; rocks, beams, casks filled
with earth, and burning faggots are hurled from
tower and curtain. Ladders laden with men give
way, the high bridges of the attacking towers fall in,
catapults take fire; host after host hurls itself forward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
wavers, and falls back upon heaps of stone,
piles of human bodies, the drawn weapons of
comrades, the dying and wounded; here and there
the thick clouds of smoke are lighted up by vivid
flames of Greek fire, while the air is rent with the
shrieks of the injured, whistles of cannon-balls, explosions
from the mines, and the forbidding roar
of Muhammad’s eighteen batteries, which command
the city from the neighboring heights. Occasionally
there comes a momentary hush, as though the opposing
forces had paused for breath: as the smoke
clears away glimpses can be caught through the
great breach near the San Romano Gate of Constantine’s
crimson mantle, or the flashing arms of Gustinian
and Francesco di Toledo, or the terrible forms
of the three hundred Genoese archers; and at that
sight the battle is resumed with renewed fury.
The smoke, rolling down in thick clouds, again conceals
the breach, ladders are flung against the walls,
fresh torrents of missiles pour from the defences, and
the dead are piled in heaps before the Adrianopolis
and Golden, the Selymbria, the Tou Tritou, the
Pempton, Rusion, Blachernæ, and Heptapyrgion
gates, while legion after legion of armed men, rising
as it were out of the very earth, beat against the walls,
pour over the moat, surmount the outer ramparts,
fall, rise again, dragging themselves up by loosened
stones, climbing over dead bodies, through clouds of
arrows, beneath hailstorms of stones, in girdles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
flame, until at length, decimated and spent, the
besiegers draw off, while a wild cry of victory
mingled with solemn chants of thanksgiving is heard
from the city’s walls. From the height facing the
San Romano Gate, Muhammad II. has followed the
battle’s course surrounded by his fourteen thousand
Janissaries, and now for a moment he seems in doubt
whether to continue the assault or abandon the
undertaking altogether; but, turning his glance
upon that throng of eager upturned faces, those
ranks of sinewy giants, whose mighty frames are
trembling with fierce and wrathful impatience, only
awaiting the word to throw themselves furiously
into the breach, his mind is made up, and, rising in
his stirrups with a gesture of haughty disdain, he
once more raises the battle-cry. Then is the vengeance
of the Almighty let loose upon that doomed
city. The fourteen thousand, responding with one
terrible cry as from a single throat, sweep forward;
throngs of dervishes speed in all directions, threatening
and collecting the scattered forces; sciaus beat
back the fugitives; the pashas again form their men
in line; and the Sultan, brandishing his iron mace
and surrounded by a cloud of flashing cimeters and
drawn bows, a sea of turbans and helmets, dashes
forward to take the field in person. From the San
Romano Gate there pours a fresh shower of missiles;
Gustinian is wounded and drops; the Italians fall
back discouraged; a gigantic Janissary, Hassan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
d’Olubad, is the first to scale the walls; Constantine,
fighting amid the remnant of his Morean heroes, is
thrown from the battlements, fights on below outside
the gate, until at last, overpowered by numbers, he
sinks among the heaps of the slain. And with him
falls the Empire of the East.</p>

<p>Tradition says that a mighty tree marks the spot
where the emperor’s body was found, but I failed to
discover any trace of it. Between the huge blocks
of stone, where streams of blood once flowed, the
ground is all white with marguerites, and clouds of
butterflies hover above. Plucking a flower by way
of remembrance, to the great bewilderment of the
watching gypsies, I resumed my walk. Before me
the walls still stretched away into the distance as far
as the eye could reach, completely hiding the city
at those points where the ground rose, so that one
would never have dreamed that just beyond those
deserted ruins there could be a great metropolis,
crowned with mighty buildings and inhabited by a
teeming population; in the hollows, however, above
the battlements, points of minarets flashed in the light,
and the summits of cupolas, roofs of Greek churches,
and tops of cypress trees stood out against the sky,
while here and there, through a gap, fleeting views
of the city would be obtained, as through a door
hastily opened and closed again&mdash;groups of houses
seemingly abandoned, deserted villages, kitchen-gardens,
pleasure-grounds, and still farther away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the fantastic outlines of Stambul palpitating in the
white heat of the mid-day sun.</p>

<p>I next came to the Tetarte Gate, now only distinguished
by means of its two towers standing close
together. All this part of the walls is in a much
better state of preservation than the rest; long
portions of the bastions of Theodosius are still standing
almost intact, as well as the charming towers
erected by the prefect Anthemius and emperor Ciro
Constantine, whose invincible summits, crowned by
fifteen centuries, seem to defy the ravages of time
and fury of man. At some points peasants have
erected upon the curtains huts whose slight construction
offers a strange contrast to the massive
masonry around them, like birds’-nests built upon the
side of some beetling cliff. And to the right are the
same interminable, unbroken succession of cypress
groves and cemeteries, rising and falling with the
rise and fall of the earth, the little valleys all gray
with tombstones: here a dervish convent is half
hidden by a circle of plane trees; there a solitary
café stands with its fountain and willow, and beyond
the trees white footpaths wind away and are lost to
view in the rising ground of the bare and arid plain,
beneath the brilliant sky, against which vultures
may be seen slowly circling upward.</p>

<p>Another quarter of an hour’s walk brought me to
the gate called <i>Yeni Mevlevi</i>, from a famous dervish
monastery opposite it. The gateway is low, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
four marble columns built into it, and a square lower
on either side, bearing an inscription of Ciro Constantine
dated 447, and another of Justinian II. and
Sophia, in which the imperial names are incorrectly
spelled&mdash;a rather striking proof of the barbaric ignorance
of the fifth century. I peered through the
gateway up at the walls, into the monastery, and the
cemetery, but there was not a living soul to be seen
anywhere, so, after resting a while with my back
against the parapet of a little bridge thrown across
the moat, I resumed my pilgrimage.</p>

<div id="if_i_9" class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;">
  <img src="images/i_120.jpg" width="513" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Dervish.</div></div>

<p>I would give my memories of the most beautiful view
in Constantinople if in exchange I could transfer to
my readers any of the profound and singular impressions
made upon me by my slow progress between
those two interminable chains of ruins and sepulchres,
beneath that eastern sun, amid that profound solitude,
that utter peacefulness. Often, at some troubled
period of my life, I had wished that I might find
myself one of a great silent caravan of mysterious
persons ever travelling through strange, unfamiliar
lands to an unknown goal. Well, that road seemed
to answer to this fanciful longing. I wanted it to
continue for ever. Far from oppressing me with
any feeling of melancholy, I was conscious of a sensation
of exhilaration and excitement: the brilliant
vegetation, the cyclopean dimensions of the walls,
the great rolling surface of the earth like the waves
of a mighty ocean, the crowding memories of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
emperors and armies, of fierce warfare, dead and
gone generations, whole nations who had passed
away, the great city so near at hand, the mortal
stillness, broken only by the beat of an eagle’s wings
taking its solitary flight from the summit of a ruined
tower,&mdash;all flooded my soul, and bore me out of myself
on a rushing tide of unutterable desires and
longings, which my mortal body seemed too small to
contain. I felt as though I ought to be two feet
taller, clad in that colossal armor of the grand elector
of Saxony which hangs in the Madrid armory, that
my tread should resound through the stillness like
the measured beat of a troop of mediæval halberdiers,
and my arms be endued with titanic strength,
that I might lift and heave into place the overturned
masses of those superb walls; and, walking thus,
with head aloft, with bent brows and clenched hands
apostrophizing in heroic verse Constantine and
Muhammad, rapt in a sort of warlike delirium, my
whole soul in the past, and the blood coursing
through my veins with all the heat and fire of first
youth, I felt so unutterably happy at being alone, so
jealous of that solitude surcharged with life, that,
had I suddenly encountered the best friend I have
in the world, I am afraid the coolness of my welcome
would have estranged him for ever.</p>

<p>I next came to the ancient military gate called
Tou Tritou, now closed. The shattered condition
of towers and curtains show that some of Orbano’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
mighty cannon must have been directed against this
portion of the defences. It is thought, indeed, that
here was one of those three breaches which Muhammad
II. pointed out to his army on the first day of
the assault, saying, “You can ride into Constantinople
on horseback through the three openings I
have made for you.” Next I came to an open gate
flanked by two octagonal towers, which, from its
small bridge supported on three charming arches of
a beautiful golden color, I identified as the <i>Silivri</i>
Gate, leading to ancient <i>Selymbria</i>, corrupted by
the Turks into <i>Silivri</i>. During the siege this gate
was defended by a Genoese, Maurizio Cottaneo.
Some of the paving laid by Justinian can still be
seen. Facing it is an enormous cemetery, beyond
which stands the celebrated Balukli monastery. On
entering the cemetery I found without difficulty the
solitary spot where are interred the heads of the
famous Ali of Tepelen, pasha of Janina, his sons
Veli, governor of Trikala; Muctar, administrator of
Arlonia, Saalih, administrator of Lepanto, and of his
nephew, Mehemed, son of Veli, administrator of Delvino.
There are five small stone columns, surmounted
by turbans, bearing the date 1827,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> and an inscription
of the simplest kind. They were erected by the
poor Soliman dervish, Ali’s boyhood’s friend, who
bought the heads after they were removed from the
Seraglio walls, and interred them with his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
hands. The inscription upon Ali’s tombstone, which
stands in the middle, reads as follows: “Here lies
the head of the celebrated Ali Pasha of Tepelen,
governor of the sanjak of Janina, who for upward
of fifty years labored for the independence of
Albania;” which proves that pious lies may be found
even upon Mussulman gravestones. Pausing for a
few moments to muse over the little corner of earth
covering that once formidable head, Hamlet’s interrogations
addressed to Yorick’s skull came into
my mind: “Where now are your klephtis, lion of
Epirus? where are your brave Arnaouts, your castles
bristling with guns, your charming pavilions
reflected in the still waters of Janina’s lake, your
buried treasures? and where, alas! the beautiful eyes
of your beloved Vasilik, that lovely unfortunate who
wandered a homeless outcast through the streets of
the capital distracted by the memories of her lost
happiness and high estate?” At this point my reflections
were disturbed by a slight noise behind me,
and, turning, I found a tall, emaciated man, clad in
a long dark tunic, gazing at me with a look of interrogation.
From his gestures I understood that he
was a monk from the Greek monastery of Balukli
offering to show me the Holy Well, and I accordingly
followed him in the direction of the church. Leading
the way across a deserted courtyard, he opened
a small door, and, having lighted a candle, conducted
me down a narrow stair beneath a low damp roof:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
at the bottom was a sort of cistern, and my guide,
holding the candle so that its rays fell upon the
water, pointed out some red fishes swimming about,
gabbling meanwhile some unintelligible rigmarole,
which was no doubt the famous legend of the miracle
of the fish. It seems that at the moment when the
Mussulmans made their final and successful assault
upon Constantinople a Greek monk was engaged in
frying fish in the monastery kitchen. Suddenly
another monk appeared in the doorway, crying that
the city had been taken. “Bah!” replied the first;
“I will believe it when I see these fish jump out of
the pan;” upon which out jumped the fish as lively
and frisky as you please, half brown and half red,
because only one side was done; and they were
religiously picked up, as any one might suppose,
and put back in the water whence they had been
originally taken; and there they are swimming to
this very day. His recital finished, the monk threw
some drops of holy water in my face, and, when
these had fallen back in his hand converted into
coin, reconducted me to the entrance, where he
stood leaning against the doorway watching my receding
figure with his dull, sleepy little eyes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> Ali Pasha was beheaded on February 5th, 1822.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>And ever on the one hand wall after wall, tower
succeeding tower, and on the other shaded cemeteries,
sometimes a green field or so, a vineyard, or
a group of deserted houses. Now and then, as I
looked ahead from some depression in the road, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
would fancy that I could see the final outline, but on
reaching high ground the same unbroken succession
would again be seen stretching away into the distance,
seemingly without end: at every few steps
new towers would come in sight, far away, one
behind the other, two or three at a time, as though
they were pressing forward and peering over one
another’s heads in the effort to see who it could be
thus daring to disturb that silence and solitude.</p>

<div id="if_i_10" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

    <div class="caption">Interior View of the Seven Towers.</div></div>

<p>All along this part of the defences the vegetation
is something quite marvellous. Spreading trees
grow from the very summits of the towers, as
though they stood in gigantic vases; garlands of
brilliant flowers, vines, and creepers droop and
wave from the battlements; while below, from the
midst of a dense undergrowth of brambles, nettles,
wild strawberries, and lentisks, plane and willow
trees cast their dark shadows across the moat and its
banks. Whole sections of the walls are completely
covered with vegetation flung like a green veil over
the brickwork and crumbling masonry, and concealing
the cracks and fissures. The moat is laid out in truck-gardens;
on its banks are flocks of sheep and goats
grazing, whose keepers, Greek boys, lie stretched out
at full length under the trees; now and then a flock of
birds flies out from the walls, and the atmosphere is
loaded with the penetrating odor of wild grass; from
those hoary ruins there comes something of the
joyous spirit of spring-time, and they look as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
though they had been decked and wreathed for the
triumphal procession of a sultana. All at once a
salt breath blew across my cheek, and, raising my
eyes, I saw far ahead of me the blue bosom of the
Sea of Marmora; at the same instant a voice seemed
to murmur in my ear, “The Castle of the Seven
Towers,” arresting me in the middle of the road
with a vague feeling of inquietude; but, presently
resuming my walk, I passed first the ancient gate
of Deuterou, and farther on the Melandesias Gate,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a>
coming at last face to face with the castle itself.
This place of ill omen, erected by Muhammad II. on
the site of the ancient Kyklobion of the Greeks<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> to
defend the city at that point where the sea and land
walls join, was later, when further victories had
rendered Stambul secure from danger of attack,
and it was consequently no longer required as a
fortress, converted into a prison. To-day it is
merely the skeleton of a castle guarded by a handful
of soldiers&mdash;a hated ruin, whose dark and gloomy
associations and sinister history are bywords among
the people of Constantinople, although strangers seldom
see more of it than the fleeting glimpse to be had
from the decks of the steamer which bears them to
the mouth of the Golden Horn. By the Turks it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
called Yedi Kuleh, and they regard it much as the
French did the Bastile and the English the Tower
of London&mdash;a monument recalling the most oppressive
days of the tyranny of the sultans.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> The Melandesias Gate is the same as the Silivri Gate, mentioned
above.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> Some authorities place the site of the Greek citadel outside
of the walls, on the Sea of Marmora.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>Looking at it from the road, the walls hide all but
two of the great towers which gave it its name, only
four of which are now standing. Two Corinthian columns
indicate the ancient Golden Gate through which
Heraclius and Narsetes made their triumphal entry:
according to a legend common to Turk and Greek
alike, it is through this gate that the Christians will
come on that day when they once more take possession
of the City of Constantine. A postern beneath
a small square tower gives admittance to the interior,
and the sentinel in slippers who drowses without usually
permits the simultaneous entry of a visitor into the
castle and a coin into his pocket. This successfully
accomplished, I found myself in a large enclosure
combining lugubriously the aspect of a cemetery
with that of a prison. All around rose massive
blackened walls, forming a pentagon crowned by
heavy towers, square and round, high and low, some
tottering to pieces, others intact and topped by high
conical roofs, overlaid with lead; innumerable flights
of half-ruined stairs led to the battlements and loopholes.
A thick, tangled growth of vegetation was
overshadowed by a group of cypress and plane trees,
above whose summits the minaret of a little mosque
could be seen, and beneath, half hidden by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
undergrowth, a group of small huts occupied by the
soldiers; in the centre of the enclosure stood the
tomb of a vizier strangled in the castle; here
and there appeared traces of an ancient redoubt,
while beneath the underbrush and along the walls
were fragments of bas-reliefs, shafts of broken
columns, and capitals half buried in the earth
and covered with moss and slime&mdash;a strange,
melancholy chaos, forbidding and oppressive, which
made me hesitate about exploring farther. After a
momentary indecision, however, I proceeded, circumspectly
though, as if afraid that a false step
might land me in a pool of blood. The huts were
shut up, the mosque closed&mdash;everything as still and
solitary as in some abandoned ruin. On the walls
may still be found traces of Greek crosses, the Constantinian
monogram, the spread wings of the Roman
eagle, and discolored bits of the decorations of the
earlier Byzantine building. Some rough inscriptions
on the stones in minute Greek characters bear
witness to the presence of Constantine’s soldiers
stationed here under the command of the Florentine
Giuliani to defend the citadel; they were evidently
executed on the day preceding the fall of Constantinople,
and the poor fellows, reconciled to death for
themselves, request only that Heaven may preserve
their city from pillage and their families from
slavery. One of the two towers flanking the rear
of the Golden Gate is the dungeon tower, in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the sultan used to confine ambassadors from those
countries with which he was at war: a number of
Latin inscriptions may be seen upon the walls traced
by the hands of the prisoners, the most recent being
those of the Venetian envoys confined during the
reign of Ahmed III., when the Morean War broke
out. The other is that far-famed tower around
which cluster all the most horrid traditions of the
castle&mdash;that tower within whose gloomy walls were
perpetrated countless deeds of blood and treachery,
where viziers and once-powerful ministers raised
their last prayers to Heaven for aid while the steps
of the executioner were without the door, or, driven
crazy by loneliness and despair, beat their heads
against the stones. In one of these living sepulchres
stood the great mortar in which the bones and flesh
of the ulemas were pounded: on the first floor is
the circular room, called the Bloody Prison, where
the condemned were secretly beheaded and their
heads thrown down a well called the Well of Blood,
whose mouth may still be seen in the centre of the
uneven floor covered with two slabs of stone. Beneath
is the so-called Rocky Cavern, lighted by a
lantern hung from the roof, where the skin of those
sentenced to be tortured was cut into strips, or boiling
pitch poured into the wounds left by the lash,
and their hands and feet pounded with clubs, the
agonized shrieks of these victims rising faint and
muffled to the ears of the prisoners in the tower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
above. In one corner of the enclosure portions
remain of the inner courtyard, where common
criminals were beheaded by night, near to which
there stood until comparatively recent times a wall
of human bones reaching nearly to the ramparts of
the castle. Near the entrance is the prison of
Osman II., the first imperial victim of the vengeance
of the Janissaries. Here the unhappy sultan, only
eighteen years of age, his strength redoubled by
despair, held his four executioners at bay until the
hand of one cowardly ruffian, seizing him unawares,
elicited a piercing cry, quickly choked by the fatal
noose.</p>

<p>Throughout all the towers, and parts of the walls
themselves, is a network of dark corridors, secret
stairways, low, ponderous doors secured with heavy
bars and beams, beneath which many a haughty
head of pasha or chamberlain, governor or imperial
prince, has bent for the last time, hurled in the
flower and vigor of youth from the height of power
and success to a dark and ignominious death, their
life-blood often staining the castle-walls, while their
wives, arrayed in their richest robes, wondered as
they sat expectantly amid the splendors of the
harem why their lord delayed his coming. Along
those narrow passage-ways reeking with moisture,
down those steep, uneven stairs, soldiers and executioners
with blood-stained hands have passed by
night, guided by the uncertain rays of a lantern, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
messengers from the Seraglio bringing a faint tantalizing
gleam of hope to some poor wretch or else
the final “No” of the Sultan, and dead bodies
with staring eyes and the horrible silken cord still
hanging from the neck been carried in the arms of
panting sciaus, exhausted with their long silent
struggle in the dim, uncertain light with the fury
born of despair.</p>

<div id="if_i_11" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">View from Interior of the Seven Towers.</div></div>

<p>At the opposite end from Stambul, on the Seraglio
Hill, was that terrible Tribunal of the Court, and
hard by it the huge executioner’s machine, surmounted
by seven great stone gallows, to which living
victims were transported by sea and land to be
offered up beneath the moon, and brought forth
again into the sunlight, mere heads and trunks;
from the heights of the tower beside it, in which he
was to die, the lonely prisoner could see by night
the brilliant lights of the Seraglio where the imperial
kiosks were all illuminated for a fête. It
gives one a positive sensation of pleasure to see that
infamous pile so transformed, as though all its victims,
unable to revenge themselves on man, had
come to life again on purpose to rend and tear it
with teeth and nails. The mighty monster, decrepit
and disarmed, gapes with its hundred mouths of
ruined doorways and disused loopholes, a mere
empty scarecrow, while rats, snakes, and yellow
scorpions eat like worms at its very vitals and swarm
through its great spent body, and an insolent vegetation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
decks it out as if in mockery with leafy garlands
and radiant bloom. After glancing in through
several doorways, and seeing nothing but flying
troops of rats, I mounted a grass-grown stair leading
to one of the curtains on the western side, whence a
view can be had of the entire building&mdash;a vast extent
of ruined towers and battlements, stairways and
ramparts, dark red or blackened with age, surrounding
a mass of vivid green, and beyond them more
towers and battlements, stretching on, on, on, belonging
to the eastern walls of Stambul; so that by half
closing the eyes one seems to be looking out over
one prodigious abandoned fortress outlined against
the blue waters of the Sea of Marmora: to the left
a large part of Stambul is visible, cut up into long,
winding streets, disappearing from view in the direction
of the ancient triumphal way of the Byzantine
emperors, which led from the Golden Gate by the
forums of Arcadius and Constantine all the way to
the royal palace. This broad and smiling view threw
the dark, forbidding pile at my feet into sharp contrast.
Leaning there against one of the battlements,
warmed by the sun, bathed in the flood of vivid
light, I gazed for a long time at the great uncovered
sepulchre below with something of the same hesitating
curiosity with which one looks at the scene
of a recently-committed crime: everywhere there
reigned a profound stillness; big lizards slid across
the walls; below, in the ditch, a toad might occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
be seen hopping about, and above the tower
ravens were flying and cawing to each other. Clouds
of insects rose from the damp ruins and buzzed
around my head, and presently, as a light breeze
stirred the air, my nostrils were saluted with the
horrible odor of a dead horse thrown in the moat
outside. A feeling of loathing and abhorrence seized
me, yet I seemed rooted to the spot, as though detained
there by magic. A dull sense of drowsiness
crept over me; through the death-like noonday hush
and the monotonous buzzing of the insects I seemed
to hear the splash of each head as it fell into the
Well of Blood; muffled dying cries rose from the
dungeons, and the voice of Brancovano’s younger son
shrieking, “My father! my father!” as he felt the
halter about his neck; and, being weary and half
blinded by the glare, my eyes gradually closed, and
as I lost consciousness for a moment all these frightful
fancies crowded into my brain with terrifying
distinctness. Fortunately, at that instant I was
aroused by a clear, piercing cry, and looking down I
saw the muezzin of the castle mosque standing upon
the balcony of the little minaret. That voice, so
solemnly sweet, so tranquil, speaking to man of his
God, heard in that spot and at that moment, stirred
me to the very depths of my being: it seemed to
proclaim in the name of all who had died within
those walls that their sufferings had not been for
nothing; that their tears had been caught, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
miseries been rewarded; that since they had forgiven
it became us to do the same; and that prayer
and utter trust in God, even though the whole world
may forsake you, are indeed the only paths to peace,
while all outside the infinite love and pity is but
worse than vain. And then, moved and touched, I
left the castle.</p>

<p>Taking the road again and skirting the walls of
Stambul, I walked toward the sea, passing close by
the Adrianopolis station. Here several railroad
lines cross each other, and I found myself among a
number of long strings of dusty, travel-stained-looking
cars. No one was in sight, and had I been
one of those fanatic Turks hostile to all European
innovations, I might easily have set fire, one after
another, to all those cars, and then proceeded
leisurely on my way quite unmolested. Starting to
walk along the track, I expected every moment to
hear the cry of some guard or other warning me off
the premises, but nothing of the sort happened, and
before long I reached the end of the land-walls,
where I supposed I would be able to enter Stambul. In
this, however, I was doomed to disappointment. The
sea- and land-walls join each other on the shore without
any sign of gateway; so, climbing a ruined mole
which runs out into the water at this point, I seated
myself on a large stone and proceeded to look about
me. In front lay the Sea of Marmora, beyond
which rose the mountains of Asia, and farther still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the blue heights of Skutari, looking very far away
indeed. The shore was utterly deserted, and I
seemed to occupy the universe alone. The waves
broke at my feet, dashing their spray up into my
face. I sat there for some time, turning over all
manner of vague fancies in my mind: first, I saw
myself come out of the Caligarian Gate and proceed
slowly down the deserted road between the
towers and cemeteries&mdash;a lonely figure, which I followed
with some curiosity as though it had been
some one else; then I amused myself with trying
to trace out Yunk through the mazes of the great
city; then I watched the waves as one after another
they broke upon the shore with a murmuring sound,
and one after another melted away in silence, seeing
in them a figure of all those peoples and armies
which from age to age had successfully hurled themselves
against the walls of Byzantium. The phalanxes
of Pausanius and Alcibiades, the legions of
Maximus and Severus, the Persian bands and hordes
of Avars, and the Sclavs, Arabs, Bulgarians, and
Croats, the armies of Michael Palæologus and
Comnenus, and those of Bayezid Ilderim, of the
second Murad, and of Muhammad the Conqueror,
vanished one after another into the infinite
silence of death, until I felt the same vague, oppressed
sensation of melancholy as that which swept
over the soul of Leopardi in the “<i>Sera del di’ di
Festa</i>” when the solitary song of the laborer died<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
away little by little, speaking to him with the voice
of the ancient peoples, reminding him that everything
on earth must pass away like the shadow of a
dream.</p>

<p>Returning thence by the way I had come, I
entered the city through the gate of the Seven
Towers, in order to skirt along the entire outer edge
of Stambul on the shore of the Sea of Marmora. To
tell the truth, I was pretty well tired out by this
time, but on these long excursions which have some
settled object a kind of dogged obstinacy usually
comes to the rescue and revives one’s flagging energies.
I can see myself now, walking, walking,
walking along that lonely high-road, beneath the
burning sun, in a sort of waking dream crowded
with familiar Turin friends, characters in novels,
views of distant countries, and vague reflections
upon human life and the immortality of the soul,
and, crowning them all, the round dinner-table of the
Hôtel de Byzance, brilliant with crystal and lights,
afar off on the heights of a city many times the size
of Stambul, and already half buried in the shades
of evening. Crossing a large Mussulman quarter,
apparently uninhabited, and which breathed something
still of the sadness and desolation of the Castle
of Seven Towers, I came to the vast Psamatia
quarter, inhabited by Greeks and Armenians, also
quite deserted and forlorn. A long, winding,
wretched-looking street, from which the black battlemented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
walls could be seen below on the right
standing out against the water’s vivid blue, brought
me to the Psamatia Gate, emerging from which I
again found myself in a Mussulman quarter, among
grated windows, closed doors, little mosques, walled
gardens, moss-grown cisterns, and abandoned fountains.
I crossed the open space formerly the Cattle
Forum: below me, on the right, was the same unbroken
line of wall and tower, tower and wall,
around me the same solitude and apparent desertion;
occasionally a dog would stop and eye me suspiciously,
or a youngster seated on the ground stare
at me round-eyed, revolving some piece of impertinence
in his mind, or the sudden opening
and shutting of a window close by reveal for an
instant a hand or the edge of a woman’s sleeve.
Making a circuit around the large Vlanga gardens,
which surrounded the ancient Theodosian Gate, I
came upon a vast tract of desolate-looking ground
showing traces of a recent fire. Then the city
seemed to fade and die away in spots and melt into
country. Dervish convents, Greek churches, and
queer little open squares broke up the line of the
streets; occasionally an old Turk would be seated
beneath the shade of a great plane tree, dozing
with the mouthpiece of the narghileh clasped between
his fingers. Proceeding on my way, I came
to a Turkish café, and stopped to get a glass of the
water which I could see displayed in the window,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
but, after calling and knocking for some time in
vain, I gave it up and went on.</p>

<p>Next I came to the Greek quarter of Yeni Kapu,
then to another Mussulman quarter, then back again
among the Greeks and Armenians of the Kuni Kapu
quarter, but all the time never losing sight of the
dark battlements and blue sea on my right, and
never meeting any living creatures but dogs, beggars,
and boys. At last the voice of the muezzin
sounded through the lonely streets announcing the
hour of sunset, and before long the shadows began
to deepen and evening set in, but still the never-ending
succession of little houses, melancholy mosques,
ugly, deserted streets, and the dark openings of side
lanes and byways continued, until I began to feel
my strength giving out, and was just on the point of
deciding to throw myself down on the mat before the
next café I came to, when, quite unexpectedly, the
huge mass of St. Sophia loomed up before me
through the gloom. Oh joyful sight! My spirits
rose at once, my strength revived, and, quickening
my steps, I soon reached the harbor, crossed the
bridge, and, behold! there before the brightly illuminated
entrance to the principal café of Galata,
were Yunk, Rosasco, Santoro, all my little Italy,
coming to meet me with beaming faces and outstretched
hands; and I heaved as long and deep
a sigh of satisfaction as ever filled the lungs of a
tired, hungry man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_142">142</a><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
At Granada one feels as though his sightseeing
had hardly begun until he has been to the Alhambra,
and it is the same way at Constantinople so long as
the interior of the Old Seraglio has not been explored.
Twenty times a day, wherever you may
be on sea or land, that hillside covered with vivid
green starts into view, tantalizing you with suggestions
of what it has to disclose, forcing itself upon
your attention, riveting the mind upon itself when
you would fain think of other things&mdash;an unsolved
enigma, a haunting mystery, which gives you no
peace until at last you yield and go there before the
appointed day, more to have done with it than for
the purpose of enjoying the sight.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, not another spot of earth in
Europe whose mere name calls into life such an extraordinary
mixture of awful and pleasing associations,
about which so much has been talked and
thought and written and guessed, which has given
rise to so many vague and contradictory rumors&mdash;been
the object of so much insatiate curiosity, of so
many stupid mistakes and extravagant tales. Now-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>a-days
any one can go there, and many who do so
come away quite unimpressed; but of one thing we
may be quite certain, and that is that when centuries
shall have elapsed, when possibly the Ottoman power
will be only a memory in Europe, and that exquisite
hill be crowned by the busy streets of a new and
populous city, no traveller will pass through them
without seeing again, in fancy, the imperial kiosks
of former days, and thinking enviously of us in the
nineteenth century who can still behold the speaking,
breathing records of that storied habitation of
the Ottomans. Who knows how many archæologists
will concentrate their painstaking research upon the
identification of a doorway or portion of a wall discovered
in the courtyard of some modern building&mdash;how
many poets will break forth into verse over a
few heaps of stones scattered along the shore? On
the other hand, it may be that hundreds of years
from now those walls will still be jealously preserved,
and scholar, lover, and artist, flocking to see them,
that strange picturesque life which was led there
for four hundred years be resuscitated and spread
over the entire surface of the globe in hundreds of
volumes and pictures.</p>

<p>It is not owing to any architectural beauty that
the interest of the whole world is directed toward
the Seraglio. Unlike the Alhambra, it is not a great
artistic monument: the Court of the Lions alone in
the Arabian palace is worth all the kiosks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
towers of the Turkish one put together. No, the
value of the Seraglio lies wholly in its great historic
interest: it illustrates and gives life to almost the
entire history of the Ottoman dynasty; upon its
walls and the trunks of its century-old trees are
engraved the most secret and intimate records of the
empire. Nothing but the period covered by the
past thirty<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> years and the two centuries preceding
the conquest of Constantinople are wanting to complete
the chronicle. From Muhammad II., who laid
its foundations, to Abdul-Megid, who abandoned it
to take up his residence in the palace of Dolmabâghcheh,
twenty-five sultans have dwelt there.
Hardly had the dynasty conquered its European
metropolis when it planted its foot upon this spot;
here it climbed to the apex of its glory, and here
its decadence began. It was at once a palace, a
fortress, and a sanctuary; here was the brain of
the empire and the heart of Islamism; it was a city
within a city, an imposing and magnificent stronghold,
inhabited by a people, guarded by an army,
embracing within its walls an infinite variety of
buildings, pleasure-grounds, and prisons, city,
country, palaces, arsenals, schools, offices, and
mosques, where fêtes, executions, religious ceremonies,
love affairs, state functions, and wild revels
succeeded one another with startling rapidity; here
sultans were born, elevated to the throne, deposed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
imprisoned, strangled; here were woven the tangled
webs of every conspiracy that threatened the empire;
here resounded the hoarse cry of every popular
tumult; hither flowed the purest gold and bluest
blood of the Turkish dominions; here was wielded
that shining blade that flashed above the heads of a
hundred different peoples; and upon this spot, for
nearly three centuries, was concentrated the gaze
of uneasy Europe, suspicious Asia, and cowering
Africa, as upon some smoking crater which threatened
at any moment to overflow and engulf the
whole earth.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> This was written in 1874.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>This huge royal residence is situated upon the
most eastern of Stambul’s seven hills, the one which
inclines gently to the edge of the Sea of Marmora,
the mouth of the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn.
It is the site formerly occupied by the Acropolis of
Byzantium, a part of the ancient city and one wing
of the great imperial palace, and is by far the most
beautiful hill in Constantinople, as well as the
promontory most favored by nature of the whole
European shore. Here converge as to a common
centre two seas and two straits; to this spot led all
the great military and commercial high-roads of
Eastern Europe; torrents of water poured into it
through the aqueducts constructed by the Byzantine
emperors; the hills of Thracia protect it from
the north winds; the sea bathes it on three sides;
Galata watches over it from the harbor; Skutari<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
mounts guard from across the Bosphorus; and the
snow-crowned heights of Bithynia close in the
Asiatic horizon. Standing alone at the extreme end
of the great metropolis in an almost isolated position,
in its beauty and strength it seems formed by nature
to act as the pedestal of a great monarchy, and to
encircle and screen the life of those princes who
were half gods.</p>

<div id="if_i_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Panorama of the Seraglio.</div></div>

<p>The entire hill is surrounded at its base by a high
battlemented wall flanked by massive towers. On
the sides toward the Sea of Marmora and the Golden
Horn this is identical with the city wall. On the
land side it was erected by Muhammad II., and
shuts the Seraglio Hill off from that one on which
the mosque of Nûri Osmaniyeh stands. Describing
a right angle near the Sublime Porte, it passes in
front of St. Sophia, and then, making a wide outward
curve, joins the walls of Stambul on the
shore. This is the outer enclosure of the Seraglio.
Properly speaking, what is meant by the Seraglio
is only that part which occupies the summit of the
hill, shut in behind high walls of its own&mdash;the
central redoubt, as it were, of the great fortress of
the hill.</p>

<p>It would be, however, nothing but wasted time
and energy to enter into a detailed description of
this spot such as it is at present. The railroad
crosses its outer walls; a disastrous fire destroyed
many of the buildings in 1865; the gardens are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
largely despoiled of their beauty; hospitals, barracks,
and military schools have been established within its
precincts; and of the old buildings which are still
standing many have been either so altered or their
original function so changed that, although the most
salient features still remain, and one finds the outline
of the Old Seraglio clearly defined, yet the number
and nature of the minor alterations and the abandonment
and neglect of the past thirty years have so
changed the character of the whole place that it
would be impossible to render a faithful description
of it as it now appears without disappointing even
the most modest expectations.</p>

<p>It will, then, be better for his sake who writes, as
well as his who reads, to describe this famous
Seraglio such as it was at the most glorious period
of the Ottoman power.</p>

<p>Any one who in those old days&mdash;say from a lofty
tower or one of the minarets of St. Sophia&mdash;could
take in the entire Seraglio Hill must have enjoyed
a sight of extraordinary beauty. Framed by the
deep blue of the sea, the Bosphorus, and the
harbor, with their semicircle of white sails, arose
the great green mass of the hill, girdled by walls
and towers and crowned by guns and sentinels.
From the centre of this forest of lofty trees, through
which innumerable footpaths glistened and flower-beds
flaunted their gay colors, rose the vast rectangle
of the Seraglio buildings, divided into three large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
courtyards, or rather little towns, built around three
irregular squares, whose roofs showed in a confused,
many-colored mass&mdash;terraces filled with flowers,
gilded cupolas, white minarets, airy pinnacles of
kiosks, great arched doorways, alternating with
gardens and groves, and half buried in foliage. It
was a little white metropolis, glittering, irregular,
light as an encampment of tents, through which
there breathed a spirit at once voluptuous, pastoral,
and warlike. In one part it was all life and movement,
in another silent and deserted as a necropolis;
here open and bathed in sunlight, there plunged in
perpetual gloom and hidden from human gaze. A
thousand zephyrs fanned it, while its unending
succession of contrasting lights and shadows, its
brilliant coloring, and subdued tints of blue and
gray were alike reflected in its marble buildings and
tiny lakes, above which soared flocks of doves and
swallows.</p>

<p>Such was the external aspect of the imperial city,
not, perhaps, so very large to the eye of one overlooking
it from above, but within so divided and
subdivided, so intricate and irregular, that servants
familiar with its inner courts for upward of fifty
years would still grow confused and take the wrong
turn, and the Janissaries when they invaded it for
the third time again lost their way.</p>

<p>The principal entrance then, as now, was the
Bâb-i-Humayûn, or Imperial Gate, opening on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
little square in which stands the fountain of Sultan
Ahmed, back of St. Sophia. It is a lofty portal
of white and black marble, richly adorned with
arabesques and crowned by a high superstructure
with eight windows and a spreading roof, the architecture
being that mixture of the Arabian and
Persian styles by which almost everything erected
by the Turks in the years immediately following
the conquest can be so readily distinguished, before
they began to copy the Byzantine architecture
around them. Above the entrance, on a marble
scroll, are the inscriptions of Muhammad II.: “May
Allah preserve the glory of its possessor for ever!
May Allah strengthen its buildings! May Allah
establish its foundations!”<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> Before this gate the
populace of Stambul used to assemble in the morning
to see which of the great men of the court or
state might have been decapitated during the previous
night, it being customary in such cases to
either suspend the heads in the niches which may
still be seen almost intact to right and left of the
entrance, or else place them in a silver basin, with
the accusation and sentence exhibited alongside, the
bodies of those victims who were sentenced to be
strangled being thrown out into the square. Here
detachments of troops from far-off armies awaited
the necessary permission to enter the outer court<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
bearing their victorious trophies and heaping on the
imperial threshold arms, flags, the skulls of vanquished
enemies, and magnificent uniforms stained
with blood.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_F" href="#FNanchor_F" class="fnanchor">F</a> The present gate is built upon the site of (but is not) the
original gate of Muhammad II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>The entrance was guarded by a powerful band
of <i>kapuji</i>, the sons of beys and pashas, gorgeously
arrayed, who, from the windows and summits of the
towers overlooked the continual procession of people
coming and going below, or held back with their
great cimeters the silent curious throng collected
without in the hope of catching, through some crack,
a fleeting glimpse of the courtyard, a brief view of
the second gateway, a suggestion at least of that
enormous and mysterious abode which was the
object of so much conjecture and dread. Passing by,
the devout Mussulman would pause to murmur a
prayer for his sublime lord; the poor and ambitious
youth picture to himself the day when he too might
possibly cross that threshold to receive the horse-tail;
the pretty ragged little maid of the street
dream gorgeous dreams, not unmixed with hope, of
the splendid existence of a kadyn; and the relatives
of state victims avert their heads and shudder;
while throughout the entire square a strict silence
was observed, broken only three times a day by the
muezzin’s voice on St. Sophia.</p>

<p>From the Humayûn Gate one enters the so-called
Court of the Janissaries, which was the first enclosure
of the Seraglio. This large courtyard is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
still surrounded by various long, irregular buildings
and shaded by groups of trees, among the latter of
which the huge plane tree of the Janissaries is conspicuous
with its mighty trunk, which the outstretched
arms of ten men cannot span. On the
left as you enter stands the church of St. Irene,
founded by Constantine the Great, and converted
into an armory by the Turks; all around stood the
Seraglio hospital, the treasury, the orange storehouses,
imperial stables, kitchens, the barracks of
the kapuji, the mint, and the residences of high officials
of the court. Beneath the plane tree may still be
seen the two small stone pillars which mark the spot
where public executions took place. Through this
enclosure every one had to pass on his way either
to the Divân or the presence of the Pâdishah: it
was like a great open anteroom, always crowded
with people and filled with bustle and confusion.
In the enormous kitchens two hundred cooks with
their assistants presided over a hundred and fifty
ovens, preparing all the food consumed by that vast
family “who ate the bread and salt of the Grand
Seignior,” while opposite crowds of guards and
attendants, feigning illness, tried to gain admission
to the luxurious and sumptuous hospital, in
which twenty physicians and an army of slaves
were kept constantly employed. Long files of mules
and camels brought provisions for the kitchens, or
arms taken from victorious battlefields to the church<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of St. Irene, where, with the sword of Muhammad
II., was that of Skanderbeg and the armlet of
Tamerlane. Tax-collectors went by, followed by
slaves laden with gold for that treasury which
already, according to Sokolli, grand vizier under
Suleiman the Magnificent, contained money enough
to pay for the construction of an entire fleet of vessels,
with silken rigging and anchors of silver; and
handsome Bulgarian grooms led up and down the
nine hundred horses of Murad IV., which fed out of
mangers of solid silver. All day long there was a
never-ceasing flash and glitter of gorgeous uniforms.
Here towered the high white turbans of the Janissaries,
and there the heron-quills of the <i>solaks</i> or
silver helmets of the <i>peiks</i>; members of the sultan’s
guard lounged about in their golden tunics fastened
about the waist with jewelled belts; the <i>zuluftu-baltagé</i>,
employed under the officials of the bed-chamber,
could be distinguished by the tuft of wool
hanging from their caps; the <i>kasseki</i> carried their
wands of office, and the <i>balta-gi</i> their axes; while
the grand vizier’s pages were furnished with whips
ornamented with silver chains. Then there were
members of the <i>bostangi</i>, or guards of the gardens,
in big purple caps&mdash;the <i>courageous guard</i>, the <i>impetuous
guard</i>, archers, lancers, treasury guards, a
countless variety of colors and devices; white
eunuchs and black, esquires, and sciaus; tall, ponderous
men, whose haughty bearing savored of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
atmosphere of the court, while their scented garments
filled the air with heavy perfume. Confused
and disorganized as this vast throng may have appeared
to the onlooker, it was, in reality, governed
by a strict and minute schedule. Every individual
who came and went through that courtyard was
something like an automaton, moved about on a
board by an unseen but powerful mechanism. At
daybreak there arrived the thirty muezzins of the
court, selected from among the sweetest singers in
Stambul, who on their way to announce the sunrise
from the minarets of the Seraglio mosques would
encounter parties of astronomers and astrologers descending
from lofty terraces where they had passed
the night in studying the heavenly bodies with a
view to determining what hours would be most propitious
for the Sultan’s various undertakings. Next
to arrive would be the head physician of the Seraglio
to inquire touching the health of his lord, and after
him a member of the <i>ulema</i> charged with the religious
instruction of his illustrious pupil. Next the
private secretary would come to read all the petitions
received in the course of the preceding day. Professors
of the arts and sciences passed through on
their way to instruct the imperial pages, and one
after another, each at his appointed hour, every individual
in the personal service of the Grand
Seignior presented himself to receive the orders for
the day. The <i>bostangi-basci</i>, general of the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
guard and governor of the Seraglio and of all the
Sultan’s villas scattered along the shores of the Bosphorus
and Propontis, came to inquire if his mighty
lord proposed to make an expedition by water, as
in that case to him belonged the honor of steering,
and to his <i>bostangi</i> that of rowing, the boat. The
master of the hunt, head falconer, and chiefs of the
vulture, white falcon, and hawk-hunt came to inquire
the Pâdishah’s will. Then all the superintendents
of the kitchens, storehouses, mint, and treasury,
and the superintendent-general of the city, arrived,
each one in his appointed order, with his memoranda,
his set speech, his train of servants, and his distinctive
style of dress. Later, the viziers of the
cupola, followed by a crowd of secretaries and hangers-on,
would be seen on their way to the Divân,
while every grade of official, up to the very highest,
would alight from horse or chair or carriage at the
second gate, beyond which no one was permitted to
go except on foot. In some way the position, rank,
or office of every individual in all that great crowd
was so plainly indicated as to be instantly distinguishable.
The shape of the turban, fashion of
the sleeves, quality of the furs, color of the facings,
ornamentation of the saddle, the wearing of moustaches
only or of a beard in addition,&mdash;each and all
gave the clue, and there was not the smallest room
for confusion or mistake. The <i>mufti</i> were dressed in
white, the viziers in pale green, the chamberlains in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
scarlet; dark blue indicated one of the six chief
justices, the chief of the <i>emirs</i>, and the judges of
Mecca, Medina, and Constantinople; the head <i>ulema</i>
wore violet, the <i>murdâs</i> and <i>sheikhs</i> light blue, while
pale sky-blue denoted a feudal <i>sciaù</i> or vizier’s
<i>agha</i>; deep green was reserved for the aghas of the
imperial staff and sacred standard-bearers; Nile
green was the uniform of the imperial stables; generals
of the army wore red shoes, officials of the
Porte yellow, members of the <i>ulema</i> turquoise-blue.
To all this careful scale of color exactly corresponded
the degree of reverence shown in the
obeisances. The <i>bostangi-basci</i>, chief of the Seraglio
police force and commander of an army of
jailors and executioners, the mere sound of whose
name or echo of whose footfall spread terror and
consternation, strode across the courtyard between
two ranks of heads bowed to the very earth; the
chief eunuch and grand marshal of the court, both
internal and external, approached, and down went
all those turbans, plumes, and helmets as though
struck by a hundred invisible hands. The grand
almoner made his progress amid a flutter of obsequious
bows. Every one in personal attendance
upon the Sultan&mdash;such as the master of the stirrup,
who assisted him to mount; master of the bed-chamber,
who brought him his sandals; the <i>silidar
agha</i>, who cleaned his armor; the white eunuch,
who licked the pavement before spreading out his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
lord’s rug; the page, who poured out the water for
his ablutions; he who handed him his arquebuse
during the hunt; and those who had charge of his
turbans and robes of black fox skin and dusted off
his jewelled plumes&mdash;were the objects of special
curiosity and veneration. A subdued murmur of
voices preceded and followed the passage of the
<i>imâm</i> of the court, and the grand master of the
wardrobe, who was charged with the distribution of
money among the people during the imperial fêtes;
while envious glances followed that fortunate Mussulman
to whose lot it fell every ten days to shave
the head of the Sultan of sultans. The crowd fell
back with marked alacrity before the head surgeon,
who circumcised the imperial princes; the chief
oculist, who prepared washes and unguents for the
eyelids of the <i>kadynas</i> and odalisques; and the
grand master of the flowers, whose life was passed
in carrying out the capricious fancies of a hundred
spoiled beauties, and who carried beneath his caftan
his diploma of poetry ornamented with gilded roses.
The head cook received his adulatory greetings,
while smiles and salutations were showered upon the
keeper of the nightingales and parrots, to whom the
doors of the most secret kiosks were thrown open.</p>

<p>It was a vast hierarchy, composed of thousands
of persons, subject to a ceremonial filling fifty
volumes, and clad in an endless variety of picturesque
costume, which thronged the great courtyard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
intermingling and separating every moment. From
time to time all the heads would turn to look after
the hurrying form of a special emissary: now it was
the vizier <i>khara khulak</i>, despatched by the Sultan
to hold a secret consultation with the grand vizier;
now a kapuji, hastening to the palace of a pasha
fallen under suspicion to acquire his instant attendance
before the Divân; or the <i>bearer of good tidings</i>
on his way to announce to the Pâdishah the safe
arrival of the great caravan at Mecca. Other
special messengers employed between the Sultan
and chief officials of the state, each one distinguished
by a title and some peculiarity of attire, would
traverse the space cleared before him by the crowd
at a run, and disappear through one or other of the
two gateways. Files of <i>kahveji</i> (coffee-bearers)
passed through to the kitchens; troops of imperial
huntsmen bending beneath the weight of their gilded
gamebags; porters laden with rich stuffs preceded
by the Grand Merchant, purchaser for the Sultan;
and bands of galley-slaves led by other slaves to
perform the heavier kinds of work in the Seraglio,&mdash;all
could be seen intent upon their several duties.
Twice daily the doors of the kitchens opened to
emit processions of scullions bearing huge pyramids
of rice, and sheep roasted whole, which they distributed
among the guards and attendants scattered
about beneath the plane trees, under the arcades,
and all along the walls, so that the great courtyard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
presently assumed the festive appearance of an encampment
of the army holding a revel. By and by
the scene would change, and now it was a foreign
ambassador who would make his stately progress
between <i>two walls of gold and silk</i> to that presence
to which, as Suleiman the Magnificent wrote to
the Shah of Persia, “flowed the entire universe.”
Side by side with ambassadors from Charles V. were
those of Francis I.; envoys from Hungary, Servia,
and Poland entered with representatives of the Genoese
and Venetian republics. The <i>peskesdgi-basci</i>,
who received all the gifts, would go as far as the
Bâb-i-Humayûn to meet the foreign caravans, and
return, amidst the curious gaze of thousands of
spectators, accompanied by elephants with gold
thrones on their backs, enormous gazelles, lions in
cages, Tartary horses, and steeds of the desert
laden with tiger-skins or shields made out of
elephants’ ears; envoys from Persia brought vases
of costly porcelain, and those from the sultans of
India golden boxes filled with jewels; African kings
sent rugs made out of the skins of young camels
torn from their mothers’ bodies, and pieces of silver
brocade which the backs of ten slaves could barely
carry; and ambassadors from northern kingdoms
brought gifts of rare furs and valuable weapons.
After a successful campaign conquered generals,
laden with chains, would be led through for exhibition
before the Pâdishah, and captive princesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
veiled and followed by their mournful little company
of disarmed and helpless attendants; eunuchs of
all colors and ranks, seized as spoils of war or
offered as gifts to the victorious princes; and in the
mean time officers of the conquering army crowded
to the treasury doors to deposit rich booty in the
shape of sabres studded with pearls and magnificent
brocades taken in the sack of some Persian city, the
gold and jewels of the vanquished Mamelukes of
Egypt, cups of gold found among the treasures of
the chevaliers of Rhodes, statues of Diana and
Apollo brought from Greece and Hungary, and the
keys of conquered cities and strongholds; and others
still, led the youths and maidens stolen from the isle
of Lesbos into the inner court. All the enormous
quantities of stores of every description brought to
the Seraglio from the various ports of Africa, Morea,
Caramania, and the Ægean Sea were either received
between those walls or flowed through them to the
inner courts, and an army of majordomos and clerks
were kept constantly occupied in registering what
was brought, giving receipts, paying out money,
and arranging audiences. Merchants from the slave-markets
of Brusa and Trebizond would await their
turn to enter with poets come from Bagdad to recite
their verses in the presence of the Sultan. Governors
fallen into disgrace, bearing basins full of
gold coins wherewith to purchase pardon, stood side
by side with the messenger of a pasha bringing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
beautiful girl of thirteen, found, after months of
careful search, in a cabin in Anatolia, as a present to
the Grand Seignior, and with them emissaries returned
from the farthermost confines of the empire,
tired little family groups just arrived from some far-off
province to seek justice at the hands of their
lord, and women and children of the lowest orders
in Stambul come to present their grievances before
the Divân. On those days when the Divân was to
hold its sessions ambassadors from rebel provinces
would be seen passing slowly through the curious
and mocking crowd, mounted upon asses, with
shaven faces and women’s caps upon their heads, or
the too insolent envoys of some Asiatic prince with
their noses split open by the cimeters of the <i>sciaùs</i>.
Sometimes state officials would pass out bearing a
magnificent shawl which they were to take to a
distant governor as a present from the grand vizier,
quite unconscious that their own death-sentence was
concealed within its folds. Now the radiant face
of some ambitious schemer showed that his plots
had been so far successful, and a <i>sanjak</i> was his,
while the pallid countenance of another proved all
too plainly that he had heard in the Divân the first
dark rumors of approaching disgrace. Messengers
went by with those inexorable <i>hattiscerifs</i> which they
were to carry in their saddle-croups three hundred
miles for the purpose of spreading ruin and death
through the palace of a viceroy, and those terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
court-mutes sent to strangle illustrious prisoners in
the subterranean dungeons of the Castle of Seven
Towers. Crowds of <i>beys</i>, <i>mollahs</i>, and <i>emirs</i> passed
back and forth, to and from audiences, with bent
heads, eyes on the ground, and hands hidden in
their big sleeves; viziers who made it a habit to
carry a copy of the Koran about with them, so as
to be prepared at a moment’s notice to read the
office of the dead; the despotic grand vizier, constantly
shadowed by an executioner, who never
went abroad without a copy of his will concealed
somewhere about his person, so as to be ready to
face death at any moment.</p>

<p>And all of them maintained the most perfect decorum,
passing by with measured steps and serious
mien, either silent or else conversing only in undertones
and in such circumspect and correct language
as was suitable to the sacred precincts of the Seraglio.
There was a constant interchange of grave, scrutinizing
looks; hands were laid on the forehead or
breast, and momentary breaks occurred in the murmured
conversations&mdash;a discreet rustling and patter
of slippers and long cloaks, a subdued clanking of
cimeters, a something monastic and mournful, which
contrasted strangely with the haughty, warlike faces,
pompous coloring, and splendid armor seen on all
sides. In every eye could be read the reflection of
the same ruling idea, on every brow was written the
awe and dread of a single man, high above them all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
wielding an absolute power over each and every
one of them, and before whom all were ready to bow
down, cringe, crawl, efface themselves; it seemed as
though every object bore the imprint of his image,
every sound carried the echo of his name.</p>

<p>From this court the Bâb-el-Selam,<a id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> Gate of
Health, gives access to the second court. It is still
standing intact, flanked by two massive towers, and
can only be passed even now on presenting a firman
or order from the Sultan. Formerly the great doors
which shut it on either side enclosed a space between
them which was used as a chamber of execution,
where persons could be detained and secretly despatched.
The cell of the executioner was just below,
and communicated by secret passage-ways with
the hall of the Divân. Persons of rank who had
incurred the displeasure of the Divân would be detained
there while awaiting their sentence, which not
infrequently was first made known to them by being
carried out. At other times a suspected governor
or vizier, summoned to the Seraglio on some pretext
or other, came, passed unsuspiciously beneath that
sinister roof, entered the council hall, and, being
received with benevolent smiles or such mitigated
severity as laid his fears to rest, would pass tranquilly
forth again, to suddenly feel a knife beneath
his shoulders or a cord about his neck, and sink to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the ground without seeing any one or being able
so much as to make one effort at resistance. At
the sound of his dying cry a hundred heads in the
outer court would turn quickly, but in an instant
every one would have resumed his occupation in
perfect silence. Presently the head would be carried
out to the Bâb-i-Humayûn, the body thrown to the
ravens on the shore near St. Stephen’s, the news sent
to the Sultan, and the whole matter be finished.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_G" href="#FNanchor_G" class="fnanchor">G</a> The name of this gate is the Orta Kapu, or Middle Gate.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>To the right and under the roof can be seen
the small iron doorway of the chamber into which
those victims were cast whose death-sentence had
been recalled just in time, or others whose agony it
was wished to prolong or who were to be sent into
exile instead.</p>

<p>Passing beneath the gateway, you enter the second
court, and begin to breathe more unmistakably the
sacred atmosphere which surrounded the lord “of
the two seas and two worlds.” Entering there for
the first time, one pauses involuntarily on the
threshold, held back by feelings of awe and veneration
and fear. It was a huge, irregular courtyard, a
sort of enormous open hall, surrounded by graceful
buildings with gold and silver domes: here and
there were groups of tall trees, while two avenues
crossed each other, flanked by great cypresses. All
around it ran a low gallery, supported on graceful
marble columns and protected by a spreading
roof covered with lead. To the left as you enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
was the hall of the Divân, surmounted by a glittering
dome, and beyond it the reception chamber, before
which stood six huge columns of Marmora
marble supporting a wide roof with undulating border.
Bases and capitals, walls, roofs, doorways,
arches, all were embossed, carved, chiselled, painted,
and gilded, and as light and graceful as pavilions
made of lace and encrusted with gems, while a
group of superb plane trees cast their shadows over
it all. On the other side were the apartments where
the robes of state were kept, the archives, the tents,
the residence of the chief of the black eunuchs, and
the kitchens of the court. Here was to be found
that intendant on whom far more devolved than on
one of the ministers of state, under whom were employed
fifty sub-lieutenants and a whole army of
cooks, supplemented on great occasions by chefs collected
from every corner of the empire. On the days
of the Divân, dinner was served here for all the
viziers, and, when such functions as imperial weddings
or circumcisions were in progress, were prepared
those far-famed pastry gardens, sugar swans,
giraffes, falcons, and camels; and roasted sheep from
which flocks of birds issued, to be carried later on
in great pomp to the Hippodrome square; here too
were manufactured those sweetmeats of every conceivable
form and flavor designed to melt away in
the thousand greedy little mouths of the harem.
On fête-days eight hundred workmen swarmed close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
by the kitchens, occupied in getting out the Sultan’s
tents and those of the harem, which they were to
erect all about the Seraglio gardens and on the hillsides
overlooking the Bosphorus; and when even
these apparently inexhaustible storehouses gave out,
pavilions were constructed from the sails of the fleet,
and cypress trees taken up by the roots from the
gardens of the imperial villas.</p>

<p>The residence of the chief eunuch near by was a
small royal palace in itself, between which and the
third court flowed a constant stream of black
eunuchs, slaves, and servants. Foreign ambassadors
passed through on their way to the reception-chamber
of the Sultan, and then the gallery would
be hung from one end to the other with scarlet cloth,
while the walls and pavements were as polished and
glittering as the floor of a room. Two hundred Janissaries,
spahis, and silidars, members of the Divân
guard, would stand drawn up in the shade of the
cypress and plane trees, dressed and armed like
princes, while troops of white and black eunuchs,
perfumed and anointed, flanked the entrance. Everything
within this second enclosure indicated the vicinity
of the Grand Seignior: voices were pitched in
a lower key, steps were more measured, and all
noises which indicated labor or toil, and the sounds
of horses’ hoofs, were rigorously banished. Soldiers
and servants alike went back and forth in silence,
and a certain sanctuary-like stillness reigned over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the entire courtyard, broken only from time to time
by the sudden cry of a bird winging its way among
the high branches of the trees or the resounding
clang of the great iron doors being swung to by the
kapuji.</p>

<p>The only one of the buildings in this court visited
by me was the hall of the Divân, which is almost
precisely as it was in the days when the deliberations
of the chief assemblage of the state were held
within its walls. It is a large, vaulted apartment,
lighted from above by small Moorish windows, lined
with marbles, covered with gold arabesques, and
without other furniture save the long divan upon
which the members of the council took their seats.
Directly above the grand vizier’s place may still be
seen the small window covered with a gilded lattice
from behind which first Suleiman I., and after him
all the other pâdishahs, took part unseen, or at all
events were supposed to take part, in the sessions.<a id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">H</a>
A secret passageway led from this hidden recess to
the imperial apartments in the third enclosure.
Here the great assembly, composed of all the chief
ministers of the empire, met five times a week,
presided over by the grand vizier. It was a most
impressive sight: facing the entrance sat the grand
vizier, and near him the viziers of the dome, the
<i>kapudan pasha</i>, or chief admiral, the two chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
justices of Anadoli and Rumili, representing the
judiciary of the provinces of Asia and Europe; on
one side the imperial treasurers, on the other the
<i>nisciandgi</i>, whose duty it was to affix the Sultan’s
seal to all decrees; beyond, to the right and left,
two long lines of ulemas and chamberlains, and in the
angles the sciaùs to whom were assigned the duties
of bearing the orders and despatches of the assembly
and carrying out the sentences, and who were
trained to comprehend at once the exact significance
of every look and gesture. Before this gathering
the boldest quailed and the most innocent began to
fearfully interrogate their own consciences. Every
one sat with immovable countenance, crossed arms,
and hands concealed in the folds of his garment;
from overhead a flood of pale golden light fell upon
the white turbans, long beards, rich furs, jewelled
dagger-hilts, and motionless figures of the council,
lending them a death-like pallor, as though a row
of statues had been dressed and colored in imitation
of life. Thick matting muffled the footfall of all
who came and went, heavy perfumes filled the air
from the rich furs of the ministers, and the green
branches of the trees in the court without were
reflected in the polished marbles of the walls, while
from time to time the silence was broken by bursts
of melody from the birds, which echoed and re-echoed
beneath the gilded roof. All the surroundings
of that awful tribunal were graceful, charming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
delicate. One at a time the different voices of the
members could be heard, subdued, monotonous, like
the murmur of a brook, so that the accused, standing
erect in the centre of the hall, would not know even
from which particular mouth the sounds issued. A
hundred great eyes were fixed with penetrating scrutiny
upon a single face, whose every shade of expression
was noted, and every smallest word that dropped
from whose lips was taken account of. The deepest,
most hidden secrets of the heart were guessed from
a change of countenance. Sometimes the death-sentence
would be pronounced in a few calm words
after long dialogues carried on in subdued tones
and listened to in sepulchral silence; or, again, it
would fall suddenly, unexpectedly, like a clap of
thunder, having its echoes in the passionate remonstrances
of a tortured soul in its supreme moment,
cut suddenly short when, at a sign from the vizier,
a cimeter would descend, cleaving the skull in twain
and staining the marbles and matting with blood.
Aghas of spahis and Janissaries would fall to the
earth, thrust through with daggers; governors and
<i>kaimacan</i> sink with staring eyes, the noose drawn
tight about their necks. In a few moments the
body would have been laid beneath the plane trees
with a green cloth thrown over it, the blood have
been wiped up, the air perfumed afresh, and, the
executioner having returned to his post, the council
would resume its deliberations with countenances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
unmoved, hands still concealed, and unruffled,
monotonous voices, while from the little Moorish
windows above the same long, slanting rays of pale
yellow light fell upon the same white turbans and
black beards. It was those haughty judges’ turn to
tremble, however, when, the Divân having incurred
the displeasure of Murad IV. or the second Selim by
some of its measures, the gilded grating which concealed
the imperial recess was suddenly heard to
resound beneath the furious fist of their supreme
lord; even then, after a long and profound silence,
during which terrified eyes furtively took counsel
of one another, the deliberations were resumed in
solemn tones and with impassive faces, but their
icy fingers trembled beneath the great sleeves and
their souls they commended to the mercy of God.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_H" href="#FNanchor_H" class="fnanchor">H</a> The sultans sat behind this lattice when giving audience to
foreign ambassadors.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>At the end of this second courtyard, which may
be called, in a certain sense, the diplomatic court
of the Seraglio, stood the third gate, flanked by
marble columns and covered by a wide, overhanging
roof, before which, night and day, a troop of white
eunuchs and a band of kapuji, armed with sabres
and daggers, stood on guard. This was the famous
Bâb-i-Sâdet, or Gate of Felicity, leading to the
third and innermost enclosure&mdash;that sacred portal
which for nearly four centuries remained obdurately
closed to every Christian who was not the representative
of a reigning sovereign or a state; that door
at which the supplicating curiosity of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
celebrated and influential travellers has knocked in
vain; that door from out of which flowed, to spread
abroad through every country on the surface of the
earth, so many wild and fantastic and romantic tales,
so many strange and mournful rumors, so many recitals
of love and adventure and shadowy whispers of
intrigues and dark conspiracies&mdash;so many volumes
of poetry, voluptuous, fantastic, and horrible. It
was the sacred threshold of the sanctuary of the king
of kings, whose name was only pronounced by the
common people with bated breath and feelings of
secret awe and terror, as though it were the portal
leading to some region of enchantment, passing
which a profane mortal might suddenly find himself
turned to stone or else behold sights which human
language would be powerless to express&mdash;a door, in
short, before which even now the most matter-of-fact,
unimaginative traveller pauses with some slight
feeling of awe, while his incredulous glance rests
upon the lengthened shadow of his own stiff hat as
it falls athwart the heavy half-closed doors.</p>

<p>And yet even this sacred precinct was not respected
by the mad billows of military revolt. Indeed, it
may be said that this particular corner of the great
courtyard, situated between the hall of the Divân
and the Bâb-i-Sâdet, is the precise spot in which the
blind fury of rebellion has committed some of its
most daring acts of insubordination. The vicar of
God sometimes beheld that gleaming sword with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
which he ruled the world turned against himself,
and that despotism which so jealously guarded every
approach to the Seraglio was the very same which,
on occasion, violated its most secret recesses. Once
the dazzling blades of the cimeters were withdrawn
from around that threatening colossus, it was easily
seen upon how fragile a support its power rested.
Armed hordes of Janissaries and spahis, pounding
down the first and second doors with clubs, poured
through in the dead of night, waving lighted torches
and brandishing on the points of their gleaming
blades the names of those ministers upon whom
they were determined to wreak their vengeance,
while their fierce shouts, reaching far beyond those
invulnerable walls, spread terror and dismay in the
very innermost recesses of their sovereign’s abode.
In vain were bags of gold and silver coins thrown
down from the summits of the walls; in vain did
terrified muftis, sheikhs, ulemas, and all the most
powerful and influential members of the court plead,
reason, implore, promise, try by every means their
fears or ingenuity could suggest to lower those
brawny arms rigid with rage and fury; in vain the
validéh sultans, half dead with fright, appeared at
the grated windows holding up to view their little
innocent children. The blind beast with a thousand
heads was unchained, and nothing would satisfy it
but living human victims, flesh to tear, blood to
pour out, heads to carry stuck on the points of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
spears; and then the Sultan would appear in person
between the battlements, even adventure as far
as the barricades of the gateway, surrounded by
trembling eunuchs and terrified pages armed with
useless daggers, and, one by one, plead for each
victim, promising, weeping, begging for mercy in
the name of his mother, his sons, the Prophet, for
the glory of the empire, the peace of the world;
but nothing would avail. A fresh outburst of insults
and threats, a waving of torches and brandishing
of cimeters, was the only response to all
entreaties; and so at last forth from the Gate of
Felicity were led ministers, viziers, generals,
eunuchs, favorites, one after another, cowering,
shrieking, swooning with terror, and on the instant
were torn in pieces by the howling pack, hacked by
a hundred blades, trodden underfoot, mangled past
recognition. Thus Murad III. surrendered his favorite
falconer to be torn in pieces before his very
eyes, as did Muhammad III. the kislaraghà Otman,
and Ghaznèfer, chief of the white eunuchs, being
moreover forced to salute the troops in the actual
presence of their bleeding and mutilated corpses.
And Murad IV. cast down the shrinking form of
his grand vizier, Hafiz, into which seventeen daggers
were instantly buried to the hilt, while Selim III.
sacrificed his entire ministry to the fury of the mob;
and then, as these weak pâdishahs returned to their
own apartments beside themselves with shame and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
impotent rage, the triumphant rebels paraded the
streets of Stambul, the lights from thousands of
torches falling upon the torn and bleeding bodies of
their victims dragged in brutal exultation in their
midst.</p>

<p>The Gate of Felicity, like the Bâb-el-Selam, is
a sort of passageway out of which one issues directly
into that mysterious enclosure, the abode of the
“brother of the sun.”</p>

<p>For my description to be effective, or for it to
give a really good idea of the character of this part
of the Seraglio, it should have a running accompaniment
of subdued music full of sudden breaks
and changes.</p>

<p>This small enchanted city, with its strange, confused
architecture, whimsical, graceful, charming,
was buried in a forest of great plane trees and
cypresses, whose mighty branches stretched far
above the roofs, casting their thick shade over an
intricate labyrinth of gardens filled with roses and
verbenas, courtyards reached by small, heavy doorways,
and narrow streets flanked by rows of pavilions
and Chinese kiosks. Footpaths led off under
the trees to little lakes fringed with myrtle, in whose
sparkling bosoms were reflected tiny white mosques
and the silver domes of buildings built to resemble
temples and cloisters, connected by covered galleries
and long files of airy columns, and wooden roofs,
inlaid and painted, overhanging arabesqued doorways,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and flights of stairs leading to balconies furnished
with carved balustrades. In every direction
were long, dim perspectives, through which fountains
could be seen sparkling in the distance, while
glimpses of marble arch and column and terrace
alternated with broad views of the Sea of Marmora,
two shores of the Bosphorus, the harbor, and
Stambul, all framed in by the deep green of the
pines and sycamores; and spreading above this
paradise that wonderful sky.</p>

<p>The buildings had been added on to one another
without any settled plan or design, just as the needs
or whims of the moment might dictate, both imposing
and flimsy, like a stage-setting, and fairly
bristling with secret passage-ways and hidden chambers,
planned by a childish jealousy which, unseen
itself, desired to see and hear everything. Although
swarming with life, this little imperial city looked
almost deserted upon the surface, as though the contemplative,
pastoral character of the ancient Ottoman
princes still brooded over the abode of their
descendants&mdash;an encampment of stone, which, with
all its pomp and splendor, still brought to mind that
other one of canvas of the wandering tribes of Tartary;
a great, spreading royal residence composed of
a hundred little princely dwellings hiding behind one
another, combining something of the confinement
and melancholy of a prison with the decorum of a
temple and the gay abandonment of the country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Before this spectacle, so full of princely magnificence
and fantastic ingenuity, the new-comer pauses to ask
himself what country he lives in or if he has fallen
into another world.</p>

<p>This was the heart of the Seraglio, whence all the
arteries of the empire drew their life, and to which
all its veins led back.</p>

<p>The first building you see on entering is the
throne-room, which is open to visitors. It is a small
square edifice, surrounded by a beautiful marble portico,
entered through a richly ornamented doorway
flanked by two charming fountains. The roof is
covered with gold arabesques, and the walls are
lined with slabs of marble and faïence set in a symmetrical
design: in the centre is a marble fountain,
and it is lighted by means of lofty windows of stained
glass. At the farther end stands the throne, fashioned
like a great bedstead, covered by a canopy
edged with pearls and supported on four slender
columns of gilded copper, ornamented with arabesques
and precious stones, and surmounted by
four golden balls and crescents, from which horses’
tails&mdash;the emblem of the military power of the
pâdishahs&mdash;are suspended.</p>

<p>Here the supreme lord held his solemn receptions
of state in the presence of the assembled court, and
here at the feet of the newly-installed Sultan were
thrown the bodies of his brothers and nephews murdered
to secure his reign from plots and conspiracies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
My first thought on entering that room was of the
nineteen unfortunate brethren of Muhammad III.
The sound of the guns which announced their father’s
death to Europe and Asia was heard in their
prisons as well, where it meant the death-knell of
them all, and soon after the Seraglio mutes threw
them in one ghastly heap at the foot of the throne:
young and old, it made no difference&mdash;some babies
whose golden heads rested upon the sturdy chests of
grown men, while even grizzled locks flowed over
the pavement beneath the feet of boys of ten or
twelve, rough prison caftans and muslin swaddling-bands
all alike enwrapping stiffened limbs and staring
faces. What rivers of blood have been reflected
in those polished marbles and beautiful porcelains
in this spot where the savage fury of Selim II., of
Murad IV., of Ahmed I., and of Ibrahim burst all
bounds, and they stood exulting witnesses of their
victims’ agonies! Here viziers have been beaten
down and trodden under foot by the sciaùs, their
brains dashed out beneath the marble fountain,
and governors conducted all the way from Syria
or Egypt, tied to an agha’s saddle, to have their
heads struck off at last; any one whose conscience
accused him did well to turn on this threshold
and bid an everlasting farewell to the blue sky and
beautiful hills of Asia, while he who came forth
alive greeted the sunshine with the feelings of a man
who had just escaped death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
The throne pavilion is not the only building to
which the public is now admitted. On coming out
from thence we pass through a number of flower-gardens
and courtyards surrounded by small buildings
and Moorish archways supported upon slender
marble columns. Here stood the college where the
imperial pages received such instruction as should fit
them for the highest offices of the state and court,
and their princely residences and recreation halls;
troops of servants waited upon them, and their masters
were selected from among the most gifted and
learned men of the empire. In the centre stood
the library, consisting of a row of graceful Saracenesque
kiosks with open peristyles; one of these
is still standing, and is chiefly noticeable for its great
bronze door ornamented with reliefs in jasper and
lapis lazuli and covered with marvellous arabesques
of foliage, stars, and figures of every conceivable
device, so intricate and so delicately executed as to
hardly seem like the work of mortal hands. Not
far from the library stands the treasury, glistening
with tiles, once the repository of fabulous riches,
consisting for the most part of weapons seized by, or
presented to, victorious sultans, and preserved by
them as curiosities; but Muhammad II., who prided
himself upon his skilful penmanship, left his inkstand
studded with diamonds to the collection. The
greater part of these treasures have now passed,
converted into gold coins, into the coffers of the public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
treasury, but in the great days of the empire this
pavilion contained a glittering array of Damascus
cimeters whose hilts were solid masses of pearls and
precious stones; huge pistols, their handles studded
with as many as two hundred diamonds; daggers, a
single one of which was worth a year’s tribute from
an Asiatic province; massive silver and steel clubs,
whose hand-pieces were of solid crystal, all chased
and gilded; and among them the jewelled aigrettes
of the Murads and Muhammads, the agate goblets in
which once sparkled the wines of Hungary at imperial
banquets, cups hollowed out of a single turquoise
which once graced the tables of shahs of
Persia, necklaces of Caramanian diamonds the size
of walnuts, pearl-studded belts, saddles overlaid with
gold, rugs glittering with gems; so that the whole
building seemed to be on fire and one’s sight and
reason alike became dazed. A little farther on, in
the middle of a lonely garden, is the famous “cage”
in which, from the fourth Muhammad’s<a id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> time on,
those of the imperial princes whose liberty seemed
to offer a menace to the peace of the throne were
kept in confinement, until, on the death of the reigning
monarch, the shouts and acclamations of the Janissaries
should call one of them to succeed him, or the
appearance of the executioner warn them to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
for death. It is built in the form of a small temple,
with massive walls unbroken by windows, and lighted
from above. Against the single door, made of iron,
a heavy stone was always rolled. Here Abdul-Aziz
passed the few days which elapsed between his
downfall and death. Here the Caligula of Ottoman
history, Ibrahim, met his horrible and wretched end,
and his image is the first which rises to confront the
visitor as he pauses at the entrance to that necropolis
of the living. The military aghas, having torn him
from the throne, dragged him hither like any common
criminal, and imprisoned him with two of his favorite
odalisques. After the first wild paroxysms
of despair he grew resigned. “This doom,” said he,
“was written upon my forehead; it is the will of
God.” Of all his great empire and that vast harem,
the scene for so many years of such acts of mad
folly, nothing remained to him but a prison-cell, two
slaves, and the Koran. Believing his life, at all
events, to be safe, his mind was at rest, and he even
cherished a hope that his boon-companions of the
barracks and taverns of Stambul might bring about
a popular reaction in his favor. But, unfortunately,
if he had forgotten that admonition in the Koran,
“When there are two khalifs, kill one of them,” the
muftis, their memories jogged by the aghas and
viziers, had not. And so it came to pass that he sat
one day upon a mat in a corner of his prison reading
aloud from the Koran to the two slaves who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
stood erect before him, their arms crossed upon their
breasts; he wore a black caftan fastened about the
waist with a tattered scarf, and upon his head a red
woollen cap, while a ray of pale light falling from
above upon his face showed it to be wasted and
waxen, but composed. Suddenly there was a dull,
hollow noise without, and, leaping to his feet as the
door opened, he confronted a sinister group upon the
threshold whose significance he understood at once.
Raising his eyes to a small grated balcony extending
out from the wall near the roof, he could distinguish
the impassive faces of a group of muftis, aghas, and
viziers upon which his doom was plainly written.
Beside himself with terror, he poured out a torrent
of prayers and supplications: “Mercy! mercy for
the Pâdishah! spare my life! If there be any among
you who have eaten my bread, save me now in God’s
name! You, Mufti Abdul-rahim, be careful of what
you are about to do; you will see very soon that
people are not all blind and stupid. I will tell you
now that Insuf-pasha advised me to have you executed
for a traitor, and I refused, and now you want
to kill me! Read the Koran, as I am doing; read
the word of God, and see how ingratitude and injustice
are condemned! Let me live, Abdul-rahim!
Life! life!”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_I" href="#FNanchor_I" class="fnanchor">I</a> It was during the reign of Muhammad III., 1595&ndash;1603, that
the custom of confining the imperial princes in the kafess, or cage,
was first introduced.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>The trembling executioner raised his eyes inquiringly
toward the gallery; but a hard, dry voice
was heard issuing from among those calm faces as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
unmoved and devoid of all expression as so many
statues. “Kara-ali,” it said, “perform your duty.”
The executioner at once attempted to seize Ibrahim
by the shoulders, but he, uttering a loud shriek,
flung himself into a corner behind the two slaves.
Kara-ali, assisted by the sciaùs, however, threw the
women aside, and again laid hold of the Pâdishah.
There was an outburst of curses and maledictions,
the sound of a heavy body being thrown violently to
the ground, a piercing cry which ended in a dull
rattle, and then profound silence. A bit of silken
cord had launched the eighteenth sultan of the house
of Osman into eternity.</p>

<p>Other buildings, in addition to the ones already
described and those of the harem, were scattered
here and there throughout the woods and gardens;
as, for instance, the baths of Selim II., comprising
thirty-two vast apartments, a mass of marbles,
gilding, and painting, and every variety of kiosk,
round and octagonal, surmounted by domes and
fantastic roofs, and enclosing rooms lined with
mother-of-pearl and decorated with Arabian inscriptions.
In every window hung a parrot’s or nightingale’s
cage, and the light streamed through stained-glass
panes in floods of blue or rose color. In some
of these kiosks the pâdishahs were wont to have
the <i>Thousand-and-One Nights</i> read aloud to them
by old dervishes; in others the little princes would
receive their first lessons in reading with appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
solemnities. There were little kiosks designed for
meditation, and others for nocturnal meetings; nests
and graceful little prison-houses erected and destroyed
in obedience to some passing fancy, and commanding
the most exquisite views of Skutari empurpled
by the setting sun, or the Olympus bathed
in silver by the rays of the moon, while the soft
winds from the Bosphorus, heavy with perfume,
made the golden crescents tremble and sway from
the summit of each slender pinnacle.</p>

<p>At last we come to where, in the most retired
part of the harem, stands the Temple of Relics, or
<i>apartment of the robes of state</i>. It was built in imitation
of the Golden Room of the Byzantine emperors,
and closed with a door of silver. Here were preserved
the mantle of the Prophet, solemnly exhibited
once a year in the presence of the entire court, his
staff, the bow enclosed in a silver case, the relics
of the Kaaba, and that awful and highly venerated
standard of the Holy War enveloped in no less than
forty silken wrappings, upon which should any
infidel be daring enough to fix his eyes, he would
be struck with instant blindness as from a stroke
of lightning. All the most sacred possessions of
the race, the most precious belongings of the royal
house, the most valuable treasures of the empire,
were preserved in that retired spot, that little veiled
shrine toward which every portion of the huge
metropolis seemed to converge, as a vast multitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
turns to prostrate itself in adoration before some
common centre.</p>

<p>In one corner of the third enclosure, that one
where the shade of the trees was thickest, the
murmur of the fountains most musical, the twittering
of the birds loudest, rose the harem, like a little
separate district of the imperial city, composed of
a great number of small white buildings surmounted
by leaden domes, shaded by orange trees and
umbrella pines, and divided from one another by
little walled gardens overrun with ivy and eglantine
and interspersed with footpaths covered with tiny
shells laid out in mosaic patterns, which wound out
of sight among roses, ebony, and myrtle trees.
Everything was on a small scale, enclosed, divided
up, and subdivided, the balconies roofed, windows
grated, loggias hidden behind rose-colored hangings,
the windows of stained glass, doors barred, and
streets open at one end only. Over all there
brooded a soft twilight, the freshness of the forest,
and a dreamy sense of mystery and calm. Here
lived and loved, suffered and obeyed, all that great
female family of the Seraglio, constantly changing
and being reinforced. It was like some large conventual
establishment whose religion consisted in
pleasure, and whose god was the Sultan. Here
were the imperial apartments; here dwelt the
kadyns, those four members of the imperial harem
who had a recognized position and rank, each one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
with her own kiosk, her little court, her state officials,
her barges hung with satin, her gilded coach, her
eunuchs and slaves, and her <i>slipper-money</i>, which
consisted of the entire revenue of a province. Here
too dwelt the validéh sultan with her innumerable
court of <i>ustàs</i>, divided into companies of twenty, each
one charged with a special duty, and all the female
relatives of the Sultan, aunts, sisters, daughters,
nieces, who, with the royal princes, formed a court
within the court. Then there were the <i>gheduelùs</i>,
the twelve most beautiful of whom, having each her
special title and duty, were selected for personal
attendance upon the Sultan; and the <i>shaghirds</i>, or
novices, undergoing the necessary course of instruction
in order to fit them for the vacant posts among
the <i>ustàs</i>; and a swarm of slaves gathered from all
lands, of every shade of complexion and type of
beauty; carefully selected from among thousands of
others, who filled the hive-like compartments of that
huge gynæceum with a rush and stir of eager,
radiant youth, a hot breath of Asiatic and African
voluptuousness, which, mounting to the head of the
god of the temple, expended itself in his fierce
passions throughout the entire empire.</p>

<p>What associations are connected with the trees of
those gardens and the walls of those little white
kiosks! How many beautiful daughters of the
Caucasus, the Archipelago, the mountains of Albania
and Ethiopia, the desert and the sea, Mussulman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Nazarene, idolator, conquered by pashas, bought by
merchants, presented by princes, stolen by corsairs,
have passed like shadows beneath those silver domes!
Can these be the selfsame walls and gardens amid
which Ibrahim, his head crowned with flowers, his
beard glittering with jewels, committed his mad acts
of folly&mdash;he who raised the price of slaves in every
market in Asia, and caused Arabian perfumes to increase
to double their usual value; which witnessed
the frantic orgies of the third Murad, father of a
hundred sons, and of Murad IV., worn out by excesses
at the age of thirty-one, and which re-echoed
to the delirious ravings of Selim II.? Here were
celebrated those strange nocturnal revels when ships
and vases of flowers were traced in fiery outlines
upon the domes and trees and roofs, their dancing
flames reflected in innumerable little mirrors like a
great burning flower-garden. Crowds of women
pressed around the bazârs overflowing with precious
objects, while eunuchs and slaves went through the
swaying measures of the dance half hidden in
clouds of burning spices and perfumes, which the
breezes from the Black Sea wafted over the entire
Seraglio, and accompanied by strains of barbaric and
warlike music.</p>

<p>Let us try to bring it all to life again, just as it
appeared on some soft April day during the reign of
Suleiman the Magnificent or the third Ahmed.</p>

<p>The sky is clear, the atmosphere heavy with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
odors of spring, the gardens a mass of bloom.
Through the network of paths still wet with dew
black eunuchs wearing gold-colored tunics and
slaves clad in garments of every hue carry baskets
and dishes covered with green cloths back and forth
between the kitchens and the various kiosks. Ustàs
of the validéh, coming hurriedly out of the little
Moorish doorways, run against the Sultan’s <i>gheduclùs</i>,
passing by with haughty mien and followed by
novice slaves carrying the imperial linen. All eyes
follow the youngest of all the <i>gheduclùs</i>, the cup-bearer,
a Syrian child, singled out by Allah, since
she has found such favor in the eyes of the Grand
Seignior that he has bestowed upon her the title of
“<i>daughter of felicity</i>,” and the sable mantle will
follow so soon as she shall have given signs of approaching
maternity. In the distance the Sultan’s
jesters are playing in the shade of the sycamores
dressed in harlequin costumes, and with them a
number of dwarfs with huge turbans on their heads,
while beyond them, again, half concealed by a
hedge, a gigantic eunuch with a slight movement of
head and hand directs five mutes charged with the
duty of carrying out punishments to present themselves
before Kizlar-aghàsi, who needs them for a
secret affair. Youths of an ambiguous beauty and
clad in rich feminine-looking garments run and
chase one another among the borders of a garden
shaded by a single huge plane tree. At another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
place a troop of slaves suddenly pause, and, separating
in two lines, bow low before the khasnadâr,
superintendent of the harem, who returns their
greetings with a stately wave of her staff adorned
with tiny silver blades and terminating in the imperial
seal. At the same moment a door opens, and
out comes one of the <i>kadyns</i>, dressed in pale blue
and enveloped in a thick white veil. She is followed
by her slaves, and is on her way to take advantage
of the permission obtained from the superintendent
on the previous day to play at battledore and shuttlecock
with another <i>kadyn</i>. Turning down a shady
alley, she meets and exchanges soft greetings with
one of the Sultan’s sisters going to the bath accompanied
by her children and maid-servants. At the
end of a sequestered path a eunuch stands before
the kiosk of another <i>kadyn</i>, awaiting permission to
admit a Hebrew woman with her wares consisting,
though not entirely, of precious stones. She has
only obtained the right of entrance to the imperial
harem after endless wirepulling and scheming, and
now carries concealed among her jewels more than
one secret missive from an ambitious pasha or daring
lover. At the extreme end of the harem enclosure
the hanum charged with the duty of examining
slaves for admission is looking for the superintendent
to inform her that the young Abyssinian
brought in the day before is, in her opinion, worthy
of being admitted among the <i>gheduclùs</i>, if a tiny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
lump on the left shoulder-blade may be overlooked.
In the mean time, the twenty nurses of the little
princes born in the course of the current year
are assembled beneath a high arbor in a pasture
planted with myrtles; a group of slaves play upon
flutes and guitars surrounded by a party of children,
dressed in blue velvet and crimson satin, who
jump and dance about or scramble merrily for the
sugarplums which the validéh sultan throws from a
neighboring terrace. Up and down the shady avenues
pass teachers of music, dancing, and embroidery,
on their way to give instruction to the <i>shaghirds</i>;
eunuchs carrying great platters heaped with sugar
parrots and lions and sweetmeats of various fantastic
shapes; slaves clasping vases of flowers or rugs in
their arms, the gifts of a <i>kadyn</i> to a sultana or the
validéh, or from the validéh to a granddaughter.
Presently the treasurer of the harem arrives, accompanied
by three slaves, and wearing the look of one
who has welcome news to communicate. Sure
enough, word has been received that the imperial
ships sent to intercept a fleet of Genoese and Venetian
galleys came up with them twenty miles from
the port of Sira, and succeeded in buying up the entire
cargo of silk and velvet for the Pâdishah’s harem.
A eunuch, arriving breathless to announce to a trembling
sultana that her son’s circumcision has been
successfully accomplished, is followed by two others
bearing upon silver and gold dishes to the mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
and validéh respectively the instruments used by the
surgeon. There is a continual opening and shutting
of doors and windows, a raising and dropping again
of curtains, that messages, letters, news, gossip may
pass in and out.</p>

<p>Any one whose gaze could have pierced through
those different roofs and domes would have looked
upon many a contrasting scene. In one apartment
a sultana, leaning against the window, gazes mournfully
between the satin curtains at the blue mountains
of Asia, thinking, possibly, of her husband,
a handsome young pasha, governor of a distant
province, who, in accordance with a certain practice,
had been torn from her arms after six short
months of happiness, so that he might have no
sons. In another small room, entirely lined with
marble and looking-glasses, a pretty fifteen-year-old
<i>kadyn</i>, who expects to receive a visit from the
Pâdishah during the day, is frolicking with the slaves
who are engaged in perfuming and anointing her,
setting off her charms to the very best advantage,
and raising little flattering choruses of delight and
surprise at every fresh revelation of her beauty.
Youthful sultanas run up and down the walled
gardens, chasing each other around gleaming marble
basins filled with goldfish, and making the shells
with which the paths are laid rattle beneath their
tiny flying feet encased in white satin slippers;
others, shrinking back in the farthest corner of darkened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
rooms with pale set faces and averted looks,
seem to be brooding over some act of despair or
revenge. In one apartment, hung with rich brocades,
children who from the hour of their birth
have been condemned to death nestle upon satin
cushions striped with gold beneath walls of mother-of-pearl;
beautiful princesses lave their shapely
limbs in baths of Paros marble; <i>gheduclùs</i> lie
stretched full length upon rugs fast asleep; groups
of slaves and servants and eunuchs pass back and
forth through covered galleries and dim corridors
and secret stairways and passages; and everywhere
curious faces peering from behind grated windows,
mute signs interchanged between terrace and garden,
furtive signals from behind half-drawn curtains, low
conversations carried on in monosyllables in the
shadow of a wall or archway, broken by a ripple
of half-suppressed laughter, followed by the swish
of feminine garments and patter of flying slippers
dying away among those cloister-like walls.</p>

<p>But lovers’ intrigues and childish escapades were
not the only pursuits which occupied the time and
attention of the occupants of that labyrinth of
gardens and temples. Politics crept in through the
cracks of doors and between window-bars, and
the power exercised there by beautiful eyes over
affairs of state was not one whit less far-reaching than
in any other royal palace of Europe; indeed, the
very monotony and seclusion of the life led by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
inmates gave an added force to their jealousies and
ambitions. Those little jewel-crowned heads from
their perfumed and luxurious prisons bent the court,
the Divân, the entire Seraglio, to their will. By
means of the eunuchs they were enabled to hold
direct communication with the muftis, viziers, and
the aghas of the Janissaries, and, as they were
allowed to have interviews with the administrators
of their personal property from behind a curtain or
through a grating, they had opportunities of keeping
themselves thoroughly informed as to every minutest
detail of the court and city, knew what especial
dangers threatened them, and were perfectly familiar
with the name and character of every official from
whom they had anything to hope or fear. Thus
equipped, they move with a sure hand and infinite
patience all the tangled threads of those conspiracies
by which they compassed the overthrow of their
enemies and the elevation of their especial favorites.
Every department of the court, every corner of the
empire, had a root, a hundred roots, in the harem,
nourished in the hearts of the validéh sultan, the
sisters of the Pâdishah, the <i>kadyns</i> and odalisques.
There was a continual plotting and scheming for the
education of this one’s son, the marriage of that
one’s daughter, to secure a dowry, to obtain precedence
at the fêtes, or the royal succession for one
of the princes&mdash;to bring about war or peace. The
whims of these spoiled beauties sent armies of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
thirty thousand Janissaries and forty thousand spahis
to strew the banks of the Danube with dead bodies,
and fleets numbering a hundred sails to dye the blue
waters of the Archipelago and Black Sea with blood.
European princes provided themselves with letters to
the harem in order to ensure the success of their
missions. Little white hands assigned the government
of provinces and positions of rank in the
army. It was the caresses of Roxalana which drew
the noose about the necks of the viziers Ahmed and
Ibrahim, and the kisses of Saffié, the beautiful
Venetian, “pearl and shell of the khalifate,” that
maintained for so many years friendly relations
between the Porte and the Venetian republic.
Murad III.’s seven <i>kadyns</i> ruled the empire for the
last twenty years of the sixteenth century, while
the beautiful Makpeiker, “image of the moon,” the
<i>kadyn</i> of the two thousand seven hundred shawls,
held undisputed sway over two seas and two
worlds from the reign of Ahmed I. to the accession
of the fourth Muhammad. Rebia Gulnuz, the
odalisque of the hundred silver carriages, ruled the
imperial Divân for the first ten years of the latter
half of the seventeenth century, and Shekerbuli, the
“<i>little lump of sugar</i>,” kept the sanguinary Ibrahim
travelling back and forth between Stambul and
Adrianople like an automaton to suit her own ends.</p>

<p>What opposing interests, what an intricate web of
jealousy, suspicion, intrigue, and petty ambition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
must have been drawn close about that omnipotent
and voluptuous little city! Wandering up and down
those paths and alley-ways, I seemed to hear all
about me the murmur of female voices, now rising
high and shrill, now dying away in the distance&mdash;expostulations,
questionings, explanations, supplications&mdash;the
entire secret chronicle of the Seraglio;
and a varied and curious one it must have been,
treating of such questions as&mdash;which of the <i>kadyns</i>
had been chosen by the Sultan to accompany him in
the summer to his kiosk at the Sweet Waters; what
dot the Pâdishah’s third daughter, who was to
marry the grand admiral, would have; if it were
really true that the herbs procured by the superintendent
Raazgié from the magician Sciugaa for the
third <i>kadyn</i>, childless these five years, had been the
cause of her having a son; if it were settled that
the favorite, Giamfeda, was to have the governorship
of Caramania for the governor of Anatoli.
From one kiosk to another the news flew that the
first <i>kadyn</i> had a child, and that the new grand
vizier, in order to outshine his predecessor, had presented
her with a cradle of solid silver set with emeralds;
that the Sultan’s favorite was not the slave
sent by the governor of Caramania at all, but the
one presented by the Kiaya-harem: that the chief
of the white eunuchs was about to die, and that in
order to obtain the long-coveted position the young
page Mehemet was to sacrifice his manhood: it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
whispered about that the plan proposed by the grand
vizier Sinau for a canal in Asia Minor was to be
abandoned, so that the progress of the work on the
new kiosk building for Baffo Sultan might not be
kept back; that <i>kadyn</i> Saharai, who was thirty-five
years old, had been crying her eyes out for the past
forty-eight hours for fear she was going to be put in
the Old Seraglio; that the buffoon Ahmed had sent
the Sultan off into such a hearty fit of laughter that
he had made him an agha of Janissaries on the spur
of the moment. And then there would be thousands
of choice bits of gossip and news to exchange in
connection with the approaching nuptials of Otman
Pasha with Ummetulla Sultan, when a bronze dragon
was to vomit fire in the At-Meidan; and about the
validéh sultan’s sable robe, whose every button
was a jewel valued at a hundred golden scudis; or
the new carriage of <i>kadyn</i> Kamarigé, “moon of
beauty;” or the tribute from Wallachia; or the little
blood-colored rose found on the neck of the <i>Shamas-hirusta</i>,
care-taker of the Sultan’s linen; or the
pretty, curly, golden hair of the Genoese ambassadress;
or the wonderful letter written with her
own hand by the first wife of the Shah of Persia in
reply to one sent her by Sultana Khurrem, “<i>the joyous
one</i>.” All the news received in the city, every
topic discussed by the Divân, every rumor afloat in
the Seraglio, was talked over and commented upon
in each individual kiosk and garden among groups<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
of busy, inquisitive little heads. Anonymous madrigals
written by pâdishahs were passed about from
mouth to mouth&mdash;the independent and melancholy
verses of Abdul-Baki, the <i>immortal</i>; the sparkling
poems of Abu-Sud, whose “every word was a
diamond;” Fuzuli’s songs, redolent of wine and
opium; and the licentious verses of Gazali. The
whole character and life of the place, however,
would change according to the tastes of the reigning
Pâdishah. Now a current of tenderness and melancholy
would creep across the face of that little
world, leaving the imprint of a certain gentle dignity
upon every brow; the passion for ease and luxury
would subside; morals and customs undergo a process
of reformation; language become purified; a
taste for devotional reading, meditation, and religious
exercises come into fashion; the very fêtes
themselves, although conducted upon the same scale
of royal magnificence, assume more the character of
gay but dignified ceremonials. And then a prince
ascends the throne trained from infancy in every
form of vice and dissipation, and immediately the
scene changes: the god of self-indulgence regains
his kingdom; veils are thrown back, noisy laughter,
free language, and shameless immodesty prevail;
messengers travel the length and width of Georgia
and Circassia in search of beauty; a hundred slaves
boast of the Grand Seignior’s preference; the kiosks
are crowded, the gardens overrun with children;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the public treasury pours out rivers of gold; the
wines of Cyprus and Hungary sparkle on flower-bedecked
tables; Sodom raises its head, Lesbos is
triumphant; faces lit up by great black eyes become
paler and more wasted; the entire harem&mdash;mad,
fevered, glutted with self-indulgence, intoxicated
with the fumes of that heavy, sensual perfumed air,
awakes one night dazed and helpless to find itself
confronted by the vengeance of God under the form
of the flashing cimeters of the Janissaries. It was
indeed too true that those nights of horror fell upon
the little flower-imbedded Babylon as well. Revolt
respected that sacred third enclosure no more than
it did the other two, and, beating down the Gate of
Felicity, poured even into the harem itself. A
hundred armed eunuchs, fighting desperately with
daggers at the doors of the kiosks, beheld the Janissaries
climb upon the roofs and break open the
cupolas, from whence, leaping into the rooms below,
they tore the infant princes from their mothers’
arms; validéhs were dragged feet foremost from
their hiding-places, fighting furiously with teeth and
nails, to be overpowered finally, pinned to the floor
by a <i>baltagi’s</i> knee, and strangled with the silken
cords of the window-curtains. Sultanas returning
to their apartments would utter a piercing shriek at
sight of the empty cradle, and, turning wildly to
interrogate their slaves, read the answer in an
ominous silence, which meant, “Go seek your son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
at the foot of the throne.” Terrified eunuchs would
bring word to a favorite, whom the sound of distant
tumult had already rendered uneasy, that her head
was demanded by the mob, and she must at once
prepare for death. The third Selim’s three <i>kadyns</i>,
condemned to the noose and sack, were aroused one
after another in the dead of night and heard each
other’s screams, dying in the darkness in the convulsive
grasp of the mutes. Vindictive jealousy
and bitter revenge filled the kiosks with tragedies
and spread terror and dismay throughout the entire
harem. The Circassian mother of Mustafa tore
Roxalana’s face; rival favorites cuffed and boxed
Shekerbuli; Tarkan Sultan beheld the dagger of
Muhammad IV. flash above the head of her offspring;
the first <i>kadyn</i> of Ahmed I. strangled the
slave who dared to be her rival with her own hands,
and in her turn fell at the Pâdishah’s feet stabbed
in the face and uttering shriek on shriek of rage and
pain. Jealous <i>kadyns</i> lay in wait for one another
in dark passage-ways, flinging out the insulting
words “bought flesh” as they pounced like tigresses
and tore their victims’ skin or buried poisoned stilettos
in their backs. Who can form any idea of
the number of secret unrecorded tragedies?&mdash;slaves
held in the fountains until they were drowned,
struck down by a blow on the temple from a dagger-hilt,
beaten to death by the eunuch’s <i>colbac</i>, or
crushed in the deadly embrace and arms of steel of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
a dozen jealous furies. Veils choke the cries of the
dying, flowers cover up the blood-stains, and two
dusky figures, moving down the dimly-lighted path,
carry a sinister something between them. The sentinels
pacing up and down upon the battlements
which overlook the Sea of Marmora are startled for a
moment by the sound of a heavy splash; then all is
still, and the dawn, awakening the harem to another
day of laughter and pleasure, whispers no tales of
that one among its thousand rooms found empty.</p>

<p>Such fancies as these kept crowding through my
mind as I wandered about that famous spot, raising
my eyes from time to time to the grated windows
of one or another of those kiosks, now as mournful
and neglected-looking as sepulchres. And yet, notwithstanding
all the horrible associations of the
place, one is conscious of a thrill of delicious
excitement, a throbbing of the pulses, a languid,
voluptuous, half-melancholy sense of pleasure, at
the thought of all the youth and beauty and loveliness
which once had its being here. These
little stairways, up and down which I pass, once
felt the pressure of their flying feet; these shady
alleys, through which I walk, have heard the soft
rustle of their garments; the roofs of these little
porticoes, against whose pillars I brush in passing,
have echoed the sound of their infantile laughter.
It seems as though some actual token of their
presence must still linger within those walls, hover<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
in the very air, and I long to search for it, to cry
aloud those famous names, one after another, over
and over again, when surely some voice, faint,
distant, ghostly, will reward my efforts, some shadowy
white-robed figure flit across a lofty terrace
or appear for a moment at the end of a dim,
leafy vista. What would I not have given, as I
scanned each barred door and grated window, to
have known behind which of them the widow of
Alexius Comnenus was confined&mdash;the most beautiful
of all the fair Lesbos prisoners, as well as the most
fascinating Grecian of her time&mdash;or where the beloved
daughter of Errizo, governor of Negropont, had
been stabbed for preferring death to the brutal caresses
of Muhammad II.! And Khurrem, Suleiman’s
favorite, at what window did she linger, graceful,
languid, her great black eyes fixed upon the Sea of
Marmora beneath their veil of silken lashes? How
often must this very path have felt the light pressure
of that fascinating Hungarian dancer’s feet who
effaced the image of Saffié from the heart of Murad
III., slipping like a blade of steel between the
imperial arms! Above this flowery bank must
Kesem, that beautiful Grecian and jealous fury who
beheld the reigns of seven sultans, have bent her
pale proud face to pluck a flower in passing. And
that gigantic Armenian who drove Ibrahim insane
for love of her, has she not plunged her great white
arms into the cool depths of this very fountain?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
And whose feet were the smaller? The fourth
Muhammad’s “<i>little favorite</i>,” two of whose slippers
together did not measure the length of a stiletto,
or Rebia Gulnuz, “<i>she who drank of the roses of
spring</i>”? And who had the prettiest blue eyes in
the Archipelago? And whose foot left no trace on the
white sand of the garden-walk? Was the hair of
Marhfiruz, “<i>the favorite of the stars of the night</i>,”
thicker and more golden than that of Miliklia, the
youthful Russian odalisque, who kept the ferocity
of the second Osman in check? And those Persian
and Arabian children who lulled Ibrahim to sleep
with their fairy-tales, and the forty maidens who
drank the third Murad’s blood, is there nothing left
of them all&mdash;not so much as a tress of hair, a thread
from a single veil, an imprint on the walls? For
answer I saw a strange, weird vision far off where
the great trees grew thickest. Beneath the long
shadowy arcades I beheld a mournful procession:
one after the other, in ghostly, never-ending succession,
they filed by&mdash;validéh sultans, sisters of
pâdishahs, <i>kadyns</i>, odalisques, slaves, children hardly
arrived at womanhood, middle-aged, old and white-haired,
timid young maidens, faces contorted with
savage jealousy, rulers of an empire, favorites of a
single day, playthings of an hour, representatives
of ten generations and a hundred peoples&mdash;leading
their children by the hand or clasping them convulsively
to their breasts. Around this one’s neck the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
noose is still hanging; from that one’s heart sticks
a dagger-hilt; the salt waters of the Sea of Marmora
drip from another’s clothes. Brilliant with jewels,
covered with dagger-thrusts, their faces contorted
from the action of poison or the long-drawn-out
agonies of the Old Seraglio, on they came, an interminable,
mute, but eloquent procession, fading away
one after another in the gloom of the cypress trees,
leaving behind them a trail of faded flowers, of
tears, and of drops of blood, which swept over my
heart in a great wave of indescribable horror and
pity.</p>

<p>Beyond the third enclosure there extends a long
level stretch of ground covered with a luxuriant
vegetation and dotted over with pretty little buildings,
in the midst of which rises the so-called Column
of Theodosius, of gray granite, surmounted by a
beautiful Corinthian capital and supported upon a
large pedestal, on one side of which may still be
traced the last two words of a Latin inscription
which ran as follows: “<i>Fortunæ reduci ob devictos
Gothos</i>.” Here the elevated plain upon which stands
the great central rectangle of the Seraglio buildings
comes to an end; beyond, as far as Seraglio Point,
and covering the entire space between the walls of
the three courts and the outer boundary-walls, rose
a great forest of plane trees, cypresses, pines,
laurels, and terebinths, all along the hillsides, and
poplars draped with vines and creepers, shading a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
succession of gardens filled with roses and heliotropes,
and laid out in the form of terraces, from
which wide flights of marble stairs led down to the
shore.</p>

<p>Along the walls facing Skutari rose the new
palace of Sultan Mahmûd, opening out on the
water by a great door of gilded copper. Near
Seraglio Point stood the summer harem, a vast
semicircular building, designed to accommodate five
hundred women, with its great courtyards and
magnificent baths and gardens&mdash;the scene of those
ingenious illuminations which under the name of
“<i>tulip festivals</i>” became so famous. Beyond the
walls, opposite the harem and just above the shore,
was placed the celebrated Seraglio Battery, consisting
of twenty guns of different designs and covered
with sculptures and inscriptions: each of these was
captured on some battlefield and from Christian
armies in the course of the earlier European wars.
The walls were furnished with eight gates, three of
them on the city side and five facing toward the sea.
Great marble terraces extended from the walls along
the banks, and subterranean passage-ways leading
from the royal palace to the gates on the Sea of
Marmora offered a means of escape to the sultans,
who could thus take ship for Skutari or Topkhâneh
in case they were besieged from the land.</p>

<p>Nor yet was this all of the Seraglio. Near the
outer walls and all along the sides of the hills there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
arose numberless other kiosks, built to imitate little
mosques or forts or tunnels, each one of which communicated
by a narrow footway, concealed behind
lofty screens of foliage, with the smaller gates of the
third court. There was the Yali Kiosk, now destroyed,
which was reflected in the waters of the
Golden Horn; there stands to-day, almost intact,
the New Kiosk, a little royal residence in itself,
circular and covered with gilt ornaments and paintings,
to which the sultans used to repair at sunset
to feast their eyes upon the spectacle of the thousand
ships riding at anchor in the port. Near the summer
harem stood the Looking-glass Kiosk, where
the treaty of peace by which Turkey ceded the
Crimea to Russia was signed in 1784, and the kiosk
of Hassan Pasha, all resplendent with gilding, its
walls covered with mirrors which threw back fantastic
reflections of the fêtes and nocturnal orgies
of the sultans. The Cannon Kiosk, out of whose
windows bodies were thrown into the Sea of
Marmora, stood hard by the battery on Cape
Seraglio. The Kiosk of the Sea, where the validéh
of Muhammad IV. held her secret councils, overhung
the spot where the waters of the Bosphorus
mingle with those of the Sea of Marmora. The
Kiosk of Roses looks out upon the esplanade where
the pages were exercised, and it was here that in
1839 the new constitution of the empire, embodied
in the Hatti Sherif of Gül-Khâneh, was signed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Some of the kiosks on the other side of the Seraglio
which are still standing are the Review Kiosk, from
which, himself unseen, the Sultan could watch all
who passed by to the Divân; the Alai Kiosk, at that
angle of the walls near St. Sophia whence Muhammad
IV. flung to his mutinous soldiers his favorite
Meleki, together with twenty-nine officials of his
court, to be torn to pieces before his eyes; and at
the far end of the wall the Sepedgiler Kiosk, near
which the sultans gave final audiences to their
admirals about sailing for the seat of war.</p>

<p>Thus the huge palace spread out and down from
the summit of its hills&mdash;where were gathered and
carefully defended all its more vital parts&mdash;to the
seashore crowned with towers, bristling with cannon,
decked with flowers, its gilded barges shooting
across the waters in all directions, its thousand perfumes
floating heavenward in a great cloud as from
some huge altar; the myriad torches of its fêtes
reflected in the placid waters; flinging from its
battlements gold to the people, dead bodies to the
waves&mdash;yesterday the plaything of a slave, to-day
the sport of a maniac, to-morrow at the mercy of
the mob, beautiful as an enchanted island and forbidding
as a living sepulchre.</p>

<p>The night is far advanced: each glittering star is
reflected in the calm bosom of the Sea of Marmora,
while the moon turns the Seraglio’s thousand domes
to silver and whitens the tips of the cypress and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
plane trees. Deep shadows are cast across the
open spaces below, and, one by one, the lights in all
those innumerable little windows are extinguished.
Mosque and kiosk rise white as snow against the
dark background of the woods, and each spire and
pointed minaret, aërial crescent, door of bronze,
and gilded grating shines and sparkles among the
trees as though part of a golden city. The imperial
residence sleeps, the last of the three great gates has
just been closed, and the far-off rattle of its huge
keys can be heard as the kapuji turns away. In
front of the Gate of Health a troop of kapujis stand
watch beneath the lofty roof, while stationed along
the wall by the Gate of Felicity, their faces in the
shadow, immovable as so many bas-reliefs, thirty
white eunuchs mount guard. From the walls and
towers hundreds of hidden sentinels keep an active
watch upon all the approaches, the sea and harbor,
the deserted streets of the city, and the huge silent
pile of St. Sophia. An occasional light still gleams
in the huge kitchens of the first court, where some
belated worker is finishing his task; then that too
disappears, and the building becomes dark. Lights
are still burning, though, in the houses of the Veznedar
Agha and the Defterdar Effendi, and there seems
to be some stir about the residence of the chief of
the black eunuchs. Eunuchs patrol the deserted
paths and wander in and out among the dark and
silent kiosks, hearing no sounds save the sighing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the trees rocked by the sea-breeze and the monotonous
murmur of the fountains. Perfect peace seems
to enfold all that little world in its calm embrace,
but only seemingly, for underneath those myriad
roofs a tide of passionate life is stirring. That vast
family of slaves, soldiers, prisoners, and servants,
with their ambitions and heart-burnings, their loves
and hates, let loose into the stillness of the night a
brood of restless longings, dreams, and visions,
which, scaling the Seraglio walls, find their way to
every corner of the globe, seeking out homes of
childhood, mothers lost in infancy, resuscitating half-forgotten
scenes of horror. Prayers and supplications
mingle with plots of vengeance in the moonlit
walks and the overmastering impulses of secret ambition.
The great palace sleeps, but it is a restless,
disturbed sleep, interrupted by sudden fearful visions
of alarm and terror; mutterings in a hundred
different languages mingle with the voices of the
night. Close together, divided by but a few walls,
sleep the dissolute page, the imâm who has preached
the word of God, the executioner who has strangled
the innocent, the imprisoned prince awaiting death,
and the enamored sultana on the eve of her nuptials.
Unhappy wretches, stripped of everything they possessed
in the world, find themselves side by side
with the possessors of fabulous riches. Beauty
which is almost divine, absurd deformity, every
form of vice and misfortune, every prostitution of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
soul and body, are to be found shut in between the
same walls.</p>

<p>Against the starlit sky are outlined the bizarre
shapes of Moorish tower and roof, and shadows of
garlands and leafy festoons play over the walls; the
fountains shimmer in the moonlight like cascades of
diamonds and sapphires; and all the perfumes of the
gardens, gathered into one powerful odor, are swept
by the breeze through every open lattice, every
crack and crevice, leaving in their wake soft, intoxicating
dreams and memories.</p>

<p>At such an hour as this the eunuch seated in the
shadow of the trees, his eyes fixed upon the soft
light issuing from a neighboring kiosk, gnaws out
his heart and touches with trembling fingers his
dagger hilt, and the poor little maid, stolen and sold
into bondage, gazes from the window of her lofty
cell with streaming eyes upon the serene horizon of
Asia, thinking with unutterable longing of the cabin
where she was born and the peaceful valley where
her fathers lie buried. At this hour, too, the galley-slave
laden with chains, the mute stained with blood,
the despised miserable dwarf, reflect with a thrill of
dismay upon the infinity of space which separates
them from that being before whom they all must
bow, and passionately interrogate the “<i>hidden
powers</i>” as to why they must be deprived of liberty,
speech, and the ordinary shape of the human form,
while everything is given to one man. And this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
too, is the hour in which the neglected and unhappy
weep, while those who are great and successful are
haunted with misgivings as they think uneasily of
the future. In some of the buildings lights are still
burning, illuminating the pale, anxious brows of the
treasurers bending over their accounts. Odalisques,
embittered by neglect, toss restlessly among their pillows,
vainly seeking sleep. Janissaries lie stretched
out upon the ground, the savage smile upon their
bronzed faces telling of dreams of carnage and plunder.
Through those thin walls come voluptuous
sighs, sobs, broken expostulations. In one kiosk
flows the accursed liquor amid a circle of dishevelled
revellers; in another a wretched sultana, mother for
but one short moment, stifles her shrieks beneath
the pillows that she may not see her child’s life-blood
flowing from the artery opened by order of the Pâdishah;
and in the marble niches of the Bâb-i-Humayûn
blood is still dropping from the heads of
beys executed at nightfall. Within the loftiest
kiosk of the third enclosure there is a room hung
with crimson brocade and flooded with soft radiance
from a Moorish lamp of chased silver suspended
from the cedar-wood roof. Upon a sable-covered
couch, surrounded by a magnificent disorder of pearl-embroidered
cushions and velvet draperies worked
in gold, there sits a beautiful brunette, enveloped
in a great white veil, who not many years before
conducted her father’s herds across the plains of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Arabia. Bending her timid gaze upon the pallid
countenance of the third Murad, who reclines half
asleep at her feet, she begins in gentle murmuring
tones: “Once upon a time there lived in Damascus
a merchant named Abu-Eiub, who had accumulated
great riches and lived in honor and prosperity.
He had one son, who was handsome and who knew
all sorts of wonderful things, and his name was Slave
of Love, and a daughter who was very beautiful,
and she was named Power of Hearts. Now, it came
to pass that Abu-Eiub died, and he left all his possessions
and all his wealth wrapped up and fastened
with seals, and upon everything was written ‘For
Bagdad.’ So, then, Slave of Love said to his
mother, ‘Why is “For Bagdad” written on everything
my father left?’ And his mother replied, ‘My
son&mdash;&mdash;’” But the Pâdishah has fallen asleep, and
the slave lets her head sink gently down among the
cushions, and sleeps as well. Every door is closed,
every light extinguished, a hundred cupolas gleam
like silver in the moonlight, crescents and gilded
lattices shine through the foliage; the fountain’s
splash and gurgle are heard through the stillness,
and at last the entire Seraglio slumbers.</p>

<p>And so for thirty years has it slept the sleep of
neglect and decay upon its solitary hill. Those
verses of the Persian poet which came into the mind
of Muhammad the Conqueror when he first set foot
in the despoiled palace of the emperors of the East<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
are equally appropriate here: “In the dwellings of
kings see where the loathsome spider weaves her
busy web, while from Erasciab’s proud summit is
heard the raven’s hoarse cry.”</p>

At this point I find that the chain of my reminiscences
is broken. I can no longer recollect clearly
what I did and saw, nor give those long, minute
descriptions which flowed so readily from my pen
when writing of the earlier part of my visit. It
was nothing now but a succession of hurried expeditions
back and forth across the Golden Horn, and
from Europe to Asia and back again, followed in the
evening by visions of populous towns, throngs of
people, forests, fleets, hills, all tinged with a faint
touch of melancholy by the ever-present shadow of
the day of departure now drawing rapidly near, as
though already these sights were only memories of
what had been. And yet through all the sense of
hurry and confusion which the thought of those last
days is sure to bring up, certain objects stand out
clearly in my memory. I remember, for instance,
very distinctly that beautiful morning on which I
visited for the first time the greater number of the
imperial mosques, and at the mere thought of it I
seem instantly to find myself surrounded by an
immense space and a solemn stillness. The tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
impression made upon one’s mind by St.
Sophia does not seem to detract from the effect produced
by the first sight of those titanic walls. Here,
as elsewhere, the religion of the conquerors has appropriated
to itself the religious art of the conquered.
Almost all the other mosques are built in imitation
of Justinian’s great basilica, with huge domes and
semi-domes, courts, and porticoes, some even having
the form of a Greek cross. But Islamism has tinged
everything with a light and color all its own, which,
joined to these familiar features, results in an altogether
different style of building, where one sees,
as it were, the horizon of an unknown world and
breathes the atmosphere surrounding a strange God.</p>

<p>These mosques have enormous naves, white,
austere, majestic in their simplicity, over which a
flood of soft, uniform light pours from numberless
windows; every object stands out distinctly from
one extremity to the other, and mind and sight seem
lulled to sleep by a dreamy sense of utter peacefulness
and calm, as though in some misty valley surmounted
by a serene white heaven; only the reverberation
of your own footsteps recalls the fact that
you are in an enclosure. There is nothing to distract
the mind; the imagination, spanning directly
and without effort the intervening space and light,
arrives at once before the object of adoration. There
is nothing to suggest either melancholy or terror&mdash;no
illusions, no mysteries, no shadowy corners in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
which the symbols of a complicated hierarchy of
supernatural beings glimmer vaguely before the
confused senses. There is the one clear, distinct,
all-compelling idea of a sole and omnipotent God,
who demands in his temple the severe nakedness of
the sunlit desert, and permits no likeness or image
of himself other than the sky. All the imperial
mosques of Constantinople possess these common
characteristics&mdash;a majesty which uplifts and a simplicity
which concentrates upon one single object
the mind of the worshipper, differing so little from
one another, even in the matter of detail, that it is
difficult to preserve any distinct recollection of them.</p>

<p>The Ahmediyeh has a peculiarly graceful and
pleasing exterior, possessing, notwithstanding its
great size, the airy lightness of a fabric built of
clouds; its dome is supported on enormous white
marble piers around which four small mosques could
be built, and it is the only one in Stambul which
can boast of the glorious girdle of six minarets.
The mosque of Suleiman, more like a little sacred
city than a single temple, where a stranger might
readily lose his way, has three great naves, and its
dome, higher than that of St. Sophia,<a id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">J</a> rests upon
four marvellous columns of red granite, suggesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
the trunks of those gigantic trees in California. The
mosque of Muhammad is a white and radiant St.
Sophia; that of Bayezid has the pre-eminence for
elegance of outline; that of Osman is built entirely
of marble; the Shazadeh mosque possesses the two
most exquisite minarets in Stambul; that in the
Ok Serai quarter is the most charming example of
the renaissance of Turkish art. The Selimiyeh is
the most severe, the mosque of Mahmûd the most
elaborate, the Validéh Sultan the most ornate.
Each one has some peculiar beauty of its own, or
else a legend or special privilege attached to it.
The Ahmediyeh guards the standard of the Prophet;
the Bayezidiyeh is crowned by clouds of pigeons;
the Suleimaniyeh can boast of inscriptions written
by the hand of Kara Hissari; in the mosque of the
Validéh Sultan is the imitation gold column which
cost the conqueror of Candia his life. Sultan
Muhammad sees, “eleven imperial mosques bow
their heads around him, even as the sheafs of
Joseph’s brothers bowed themselves before his
sheaf.” In one may be seen the columns carried
away from the imperial palace and Augusteon of
Justinian which formerly supported statues of
Venus, Theodora, and Eudoxia; in others are
marbles from the ancient churches of Chalcedon,
pillars from the ruins of Troy, columns from
Egyptian temples, precious stained glass stolen from
Persian palaces, building materials, the plunder of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
circus and forum, aqueduct and basilica, all engulfed
and lost sight of in the white immensity of
the religious art of the victors.</p>

<p>The interiors differ from one another even less
than the exteriors. At the farther end is a marble
pulpit, facing it, the Sultan’s seat enclosed within a
gilded lattice; beside the <i>mihrab</i> stand two huge
candelabra supporting tapers which look like the
trunks of palm trees; innumerable lamps composed
of large crystal globes are disposed about the nave
in so singular a manner as to seem more fitting
adjuncts of a grand ball than of religious solemnities.
Inscriptions encircling the columns, doorways, and
windows, friezes painted in imitation of marble, and
floral designs executed in stained glass are the sole
attempts at ornamentation which break the white
monotony of those lofty walls. The marble treasures
of the pavements in the vestibules, the galleries
surrounding the courtyards, the ablutionary fountains,
and minarets do not impair at all the character
of charming yet severe simplicity which marks those
great white fabrics, framed in verdure, whose lofty
domes stand out clear and sparkling against the blue
sky.</p>

<p>And, after all, the <i>jami</i>&mdash;that is, the mosque
proper&mdash;covers only a minor part of the enclosure
which goes by its name, the rest being taken up by
a labyrinth of courtyards and buildings, consisting
of auditoriums, where the Koran is read; treasuries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
where private individuals deposit their valuables for
safe-keeping; academies, medical colleges, children’s
schools, quarters for students, and soup-kitchens for
the poor; insane asylums, hospitals, khâns for travellers,
and baths&mdash;a little philanthropic settlement
nestling at the base of the lofty temple as at that of
a mountain, and shaded by mighty trees.</p>

<p>Now, however, all these things have faded into
one another in my memory. I only see the tiny
black speck of my own insignificant self wandering
like a detached atom up and down those vast naves,
between two lines of diminutive Turks prostrated at
their devotions. As I move on, dazzled by the pervading
whiteness, stupefied by the strange light,
awed and subdued by the immensity around me,
dragging my worn slippers&mdash;and my humbled pride
as a descriptive writer as well&mdash;it seems as though
one mosque melted into another, and that all around
me in every direction there arose interminable ranks
of roofs and pilasters, a white illimitable throng in
which sight and sense are swallowed up.</p>

<p>My recollections of how I passed another day are
full of mystery and crowded with phantom shapes.
Entering the courtyard of a Mussulman private
house, and descending by the light of a torch to the
very lowest of a flight of damp, mouldy stairs, I
found myself beneath the vaulted roof of the Yeri
Betan Serai, the great cistern basilica of Constantine,
whose confines, according to vulgar belief in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Constantinople, are unknown; the greenish waters
lose themselves in the distance beneath the black
roof, lit up here and there by a vivid ray of light,
which seems only to increase the horror of the surrounding
darkness. The crimson flame from our
torch throws a lurid glare over the arches nearest
to us, falls in slanting rays upon the dripping walls,
and brings into view dim, confused tiers of columns
intercepting the perspective in all directions like the
tree-trunks of some vast submerged forest. The
imagination, drawn on in spite of itself by a sort of
horrible fascination, penetrates those sepulchral galleries,
hovers above the face of those gloomy waters,
and finally loses itself amid the intricate windings of
those endless columns. Meanwhile the dragoman is
murmuring in one’s ear blood-curdling tales of adventurous
persons who have embarked upon those
waters and started off with the intention of exploring
their farthermost limits, only to return, long
hours afterward, with blanched faces and hair on
end, while behind them could be heard boisterous
shouts of mocking laughter and piercing shrieks,
which echoed and re-echoed beneath the vaulted
roof; and others, again, who never returned at all,
having met their end&mdash;who knows how?&mdash;driven
insane, perhaps, by terror, or possibly starved to
death, or drawn by mysterious currents to some unknown
abyss far away from Stambul, God only can
tell where. Issuing once more into the broad, sunny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
light of the At-Meidan square, all these gloomy
fancies at once take flight, and a few minutes later
we again descend, and find ourselves surrounded by
the two hundred pillars of the dry cistern of Binbûr,
where a hundred Greek silk-spinners are singing a
martial song as they work in the pale, unearthly
light broken by interlacing lines of arches, while
from overhead comes the dull, confused rumble
of a passing caravan. Then fresh air and sunlight
again, followed by another plunge into semi-obscurity,
more rows of columns and vaulted roofs,
and the stillness of the tomb broken by far-away
voices; and so on until evening&mdash;altogether a mysterious,
unearthly sort of pilgrimage, which left a
haunting mental impression for long after of a
vast subterranean sea which, having already engulfed
the Greek empire, was destined one day to
draw gay, thoughtless, unheeding Stambul into its
shadowy depths as well.</p>

<div id="if_i_16" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_222.jpg" width="600" height="465" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Ancient fountain at Scutari.</div></div>

<p>These depressing fancies, however, were entirely
dispelled by the gay image of Skutari. Whenever
we went there, embarking upon one of the crowded
little steamers for the purpose, my friend and I used
invariably to get into a discussion as to which ranked
first in point of beauty&mdash;Skutari or the two banks
of the Golden Horn. Yunk preferred the former,
but I held out for Stambul. Nevertheless, Skutari
captivated me by its sudden, unexpected changes
of aspect: it seems to mock all those who approach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
it by water. From the Sea of Marmora
it is only a big village scattered over a hillside;
from the Golden Horn you realize that it is a town;
but when the steamboat, after rounding the most advanced
point on the Asiatic shore, proceeds in a
straight line toward the harbor, the little town
spreads out in the most astounding fashion; other
hills, quite covered with buildings, come into sight,
rising one behind the other; the valleys are filled
with houses; villas crown the heights; the outskirts
stretch away along the shore as far as the eye can
reach; and you find that you are approaching a
great city, which in the course of a few minutes has
come into view from some obscure hiding-place,
much as though a huge curtain had been rolled
back, and you gaze stupidly at it, half expecting to
see it disappear at any moment with the same suddenness
with which it came. Landing by means of
a wooden gang-plank, and amid the shouts and vociferations
of boatmen, dragomen, and others with
horses to hire, we mount the principal street,
which winds up the hillside among yellow and red
houses decked with vines and creepers, and between
garden-walls, over which a mass of verdure trails
and clambers: overhead tall trellisworks and lofty
plane trees cast their shade, the latter so large as to
sometimes nearly close the street. As we go on
we pass Turkish cafés, before which lounges the
usual crowd of Asiatic idlers, smoking, stretched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
out at full length, their gaze fixed on no one
knows what. Then we meet a herd of goats;
heavy country carts jolt slowly by, drawn by oxen
with wreaths of flowers on their heads; peasants,
some in fez and others in turban, pass us on the
road; Mussulman funeral processions, and groups
of <i>hanums</i>, spending the summer in their country-houses,
carrying great bunches of flowers or sprays
of blossoms in their hands. We seem to be in
another Stambul, less mysterious, but gayer and
more cheerful than she of the Seven Hills. This
one is more like a great city of villas into which
the country is making inroads on every side.
The little back streets lined with stables rise and
descend again over hill and valley, swallowed up at
last by the green of park and garden. On the
heights the profound peace of the country still
reigns, but lower down there is all the stir and activity
of a seaport town. From the huge barracks
which rise here and there comes a confused sound of
bugle-calls, snatches of songs, and the beating of
drums, while clouds of birds fly about and settle in
the quiet lanes and byways.</p>

<p>Following in the wake of a funeral procession, we
finally leave the town, and, entering the famous
cemetery, are soon lost in that vast forest of mighty
cypress trees which extends in one direction toward
the Sea of Marmora and in the other toward the
Golden Horn, covering a large area of undulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
ground. On all sides there is nothing but group
on group, row on row, of glimmering white tombstones
outlined against the turf and gay colors of the
wild flowers, and an intricate network of footpaths
winding in and out among the trunks of the trees,
crowded so closely together as barely to allow any
view of the horizon stretching away in a long shimmering
line. We wander aimlessly among the
little painted and gilded columns, some erect, others
toppling over or fallen flat, and between railings of
family sepulchres, mausoleums of dead pashas, rude
tombstones of the poor. Here and there lie bunches
of faded flowers, and sometimes, where the earth has
been disturbed, the light falls upon a half-buried
skull; on and on, no sound save the cooing of doves
concealed overhead amid the branches of the cypress
trees; and the farther we go the more does
the forest seem to expand, the tombstones multiply,
the paths increase in number, the shining strips of
the horizon recede into the distance, and the reign
of death keeps pace with us step by step, until
at length, just as we begin to despair of ever finding
our way out, we issue quite unexpectedly upon
the wide avenue leading to the vast open plain of
Haidar Pasha, where the Mussulman troops once
assembled preparatory to setting out for the Asiatic
wars. The view from thence, embracing the Sea of
Marmora, Stambul, the mouth of the Golden Horn,
Galata, and Pera, all veiled beneath the light morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
mist and tinted with the colors of paradise, is
so exquisitely lovely that we catch our breath with
something of the same incredulous wonder with
which we first beheld those shores.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cheragan Palace.</span></h3>

<p>Another morning we found ourselves seated in a
tram-car between two colossal black eunuchs charged
by one of Abdul Aziz’s aides-de-camp with the duty
of escorting us over the imperial palace of Cheragan,
situated on the Bosphorus just below Beshiktash.
I recall distinctly the mingled feeling of curiosity
and repulsion with which I looked out of the
corner of my eye at the eunuch beside me, towering
above me by nearly a head, and with one mighty
hand resting open upon his knee. Every time I
turned I could catch the faint perfume of essence
of bergamot with which his sleek, correct court
costume was scented. When the car stopped I
put my hand in my pocket to draw out my purse,
but the enormous hand of the eunuch closed upon
my own like a steel vise, and his great eyes met
mine with a warning look, as who should say,
“Christian, refrain from offering me such an insult,
or I will break every bone in your body.”</p>

<p>Alighting before a small door covered with arabesques,
we entered a long corridor, where we were
presently met by a party of servants in livery, who
conducted us up a wide stairway leading to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
royal apartments. Here, at all events, there was no
need to recall historical associations in order to obtain
a vivid and life-like impression. The air was
still warm with the breath of the court. The wide
divans covered with satin and velvet which extended
along the walls were the very same upon which but
a few weeks before the Sultan’s odalisques had reclined:
a vague suggestion of warm, sensuous life
still floated in the air. We walked through a long succession
of gorgeous rooms, some decorated after the
European fashion, others after the Moorish, all rich
and beautiful, but possessing a sort of stately simplicity
which awed us, making us talk in subdued
tones, while all the time the eunuchs, muttering a
string of unintelligible remarks and explanations,
pointed out now a certain corner, now a doorway,
with the wary gestures of those who reveal something
secret and mysterious. Silken hangings,
many-hued carpets, mosaic tables&mdash;rich oil paintings
hung where the light could fall upon them&mdash;graceful
archways of the doors, divided in the middle by
little Arabian pillars, lofty candelabra&mdash;resembling
crystal trees&mdash;which tinkled musically as we shook
them in passing,&mdash;all these things followed so close
upon one another that they became a confused medley
almost as soon as seen, our minds being more
intent upon visions of possible flying odalisques
taken by surprise. The only thing of which I retained
any distinct impression was the Sultan’s bath-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>room,
of white marble and carved to represent
stalactites, hanging flowers, lace, and delicate fretwork,
all so airy and light that one feared to touch
it with so much as the point of a finger for fear of
its breaking. The arrangement of the rooms reminded
me a little of the Alhambra. We passed
through them hurriedly, noiselessly over the thick
carpets, almost furtively. From time to time a
eunuch would pull a cord, a green curtain would
roll up, and through a wide window would be seen
the Bosphorus, Asia, hundreds of vessels, floods of
light; then it would all disappear, and we would be
left dazed and blinded as though a lamp had been
flashed in our eyes. From one window we caught
sight of a little garden the high blank walls of which,
as bare and forbidding-looking as those of a convent,
suggested at once all sorts of fancies about beautiful
women deprived of love and liberty, and then it was
suddenly shut out of view by the dropping of the
curtain. The rooms seemed unending, and at the
sight of each new doorway we would quicken our
steps, hoping this time to enter before we were expected;
but all in vain: not so much as the flutter
of a garment rewarded our efforts; every odalisque
had vanished, and a profound and death-like stillness
hung over the entire building. That rustling sound
which made us turn and glance back so quickly was
but the noise of the heavy brocade curtain as it fell
back in place, while the silvery tinkle of the crystal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
candelabras mocked us by its resemblance to the light
laughter of some hidden fair one.</p>

  <img src="images/i_228.jpg" width="600" height="475" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Cemetery of Eyûb and View of the Golden Horn.</div></div>

<p>And so at last we became utterly wearied out by
this never-ending progress through the silent palace
and amid that lifeless magnificence&mdash;tired of seeing
the black faces of the eunuchs, the watchful, sedate
crowd of servants, and our own incongruous Bohemian
countenances reflected in the huge mirrors
which lined the walls; and, reaching the last door
almost on a run, we breathed a sigh of heartfelt
satisfaction at finding ourselves once more in the
open air surrounded by the miserable dwellings and
ragged, clamorous population of the Topkhâneh
quarter.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Eyûb.</span></h3>

<p>And can I ever forget the necropolis of Eyûb?
We went there one evening at sunset, and I always
think of it just as it looked at that time, lit up by
the last gleams of daylight. A small käik landed us
at the farther end of the Golden Horn, and we
climbed up to the “consecrated ground” of the
Osmans by a steep, narrow path lined with sepulchres.
At that hour the stone-cutters who work
at the tombstones during the day, making the vast
cemetery resound beneath the sharp blows of their
hammers, had dispersed to their homes, and the
whole place was completely deserted. We moved
forward circumspectly, peering cautiously around to
see if we could detect the menacing form of imâm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
or dervish, as the profane curiosity of a <i>giaour</i> is
less tolerated there than in almost any other sacred
spot; but, seeing neither turban nor stiff hat, we
finally reached the mysterious Eyûb mosque, whose
shining domes and airy minarets we had so often
beheld from the hilltops of the opposite shore, as
well as from every little bay and inlet in the Golden
Horn. In the court, shaded by a mighty plane tree,
stands the kiosk-shaped mausoleum of the famous
standard-bearer of the Prophet, Abu Eyûb, perpetually
lit up by a circle of lamps. He lost his life
when the Arabs first besieged Byzantium, and his
place of sepulture having been discovered eight
centuries later by Muhammad the Conqueror, he
consecrated this mosque to his memory; and it is
there that each successive sultan presents himself on
his accession to be girded with the sword of Osman.
It is considered the most sacred mosque in Constantinople,
just as the cemetery which surrounds it is
more highly revered than any other. In the shade
of the great trees which surround the mosque stand
türbehs of sultanas, viziers, and distinguished officials
of the court, encircled by flowers, gorgeous
with marbles and gilt arabesques, and covered with
pompous inscriptions. On one side is the small
mortuary temple of the muftis, surmounted by an
octagonal dome, beneath which repose the bodies of
great ecclesiastics in enormous catafalques ornamented
with huge muslin turbans. It is a city of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
tombs, white, shaded, whose sedate beauty combines
a religious melancholy with a breath of worldliness,
like a very aristocratic neighborhood whose well-bred
quiet proceeds from pride. The paths run between
white walls and graceful railings, over which
vines trail and clamber from the little gardens surrounding
the graves; acacia trees stretch forth their
branches to meet and mingle overhead with those
of oak and myrtle, and through the gilded latticework
of the arched windows of the türbehs
may be seen, in the dim, soft light within, marble
mausoleums tinged with green from the reflections
of the trees. In no other place in Stambul is seen
to such advantage the Mussulman art of rendering
the idea of death agreeable and robbing it of all its
terrors. It is at once a necropolis, a royal dwelling-place,
a garden, a pantheon, full of gentle melancholy
and charm, and simultaneously with the prayer which
rises to your lips there comes a smile. On all sides
extends the cemetery, shaded by the hundred-year-old
cypresses, crossed by winding paths, white with
innumerable tombstones, which seem to be hurrying
down the hillside to dip themselves in the sparkling
water or pressing forward curiously to the pathways
to watch the passage of phantom shapes. And from
any number of secluded little nooks, through the
spreading branches of the trees, confused glimpses
are caught&mdash;far off to the right&mdash;of Stambul, looking
like a succession of blue towns detached from one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
another; and below&mdash;the Golden Horn, reflecting the
last rays of the sun, while opposite lie Sudlujè,
Kaliji Oghlu, Piri Pasha, Haskeni; and beyond&mdash;the
large district of Kassim and the vague profile of
Galata, fading away in the wonderful blending of
soft, tremulous tints which hardly seem as though
they belonged to this world.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Janissary Museum.</span></h3>

<p>All these impressions have been temporarily effaced,
and I find myself marching through a long
suite of bare rooms between two rows of immovable,
staring figures, which are like those of so many
corpses fastened upright against the walls. I never
remember to have experienced so decided a feeling
of shrinking anywhere else, unless it was in the
last room of Mme. Tussaud’s exhibition in London,
where, in the somewhat subdued light, you are confronted
with the life-like presentments of all of
England’s most notorious criminals. This, however,
is like a museum of spectres, or rather like an open
sepulchre in which you behold the mummified forms
of all the most famous personages of that magnificent,
savage, ferocious Turkey which no longer
exists, save in the memory of a few old men or the
imaginative brain of some poet. There are a hundred
large wooden figures colored like life and clad
in various styles of ancient costume, standing
erect in stiff, haughty attitudes, with heads thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
back and blank staring eyes, and hands resting upon
their sword-hilts, as though only awaiting the word
to draw and begin shedding human blood, just as in
the good old times. First, there is the household
of the Pâdishah&mdash;the chief eunuch and grand vizier,
the muftis, chamberlains, and head officials&mdash;wearing
turbans upon their heads of every color, pyramidal,
round, square, huge, exaggerated; long caftans of
every conceivable hue, made out of brocade and
covered with embroidery; tunics of white or crimson
silk, bound about the waist with Cashmere scarfs;
gold-embroidered waistcoats, the breasts all glittering
with gold and silver medals; and magnificent
armor&mdash;two long, spectral files, at once fantastic and
gorgeous, from which a pretty fair idea may be obtained
of the character of the ancient Ottoman court
with its savage pomp and haughty pride. Next
come the pages bearing the Pâdishah’s furs, his turbans,
stool, and sword; then the guards of the gardens
and gates, the Sultan’s guard, and the white
and black eunuchs, with faces like Magi or idols,
glittering, plumed, their heads covered with Persian
fur, or wearing metal helmets or purple caps, or odd-looking
turbans shaped like crescents, cones, and
reversed pyramids: they are armed with steel
clubs, murderous-looking daggers, and whips, like a
band of cut-throats and assassins. One regards you
with a look of suspicious contempt; another grinds
his teeth; another gazes straight ahead of him, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
eyes grown callous from the sight of blood; while a
fourth wears upon his lips a smile that is truly devilish.
After these follows the corps of the Janissaries,
accompanied by its patron saint, Emin Baba,
an emaciated individual clad in a white tunic, and
officers of every grade, each personating some office
connected with the kitchen: all the ranks of the
soldiers are represented, wearing the various uniforms
and emblems of that insolent corps which
finally met its end under the grape-shot of Mahmûd.
The childishness, at once grotesque and puerile, of
these costumes, combined with the ferocious memories
they evoke, produces the impression of a
savage Carnival. No artist, however unbridled his
imagination might be, could ever succeed in portraying
such a mad confusion of royal costumes, ecclesiastical
vestments, and garments suitable for
brigands and buffoons. The “water-carriers,” the
“soup-makers,” the “chief cooks,” the “head of
the scullions,” soldiers to whom were assigned all
sorts of special duties, succeed one another in long
lines, with brushes and ladles fastened to their turbans,
bells hung from their tunics, carrying leather
bottles and the famous kettles which sounded the
signal for revolt, clad in large fur caps and long
cloaks falling from neck to heels like magicians’
mantles, with their wide belts made of round disks
of engraved metal, their huge sabres, their fishy
eyes, their enormous chests, and faces set in every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
variety of derision, menace, and insult. Last of all
come the Seraglio mutes, silken noose in hand, and
the dwarfs and buffoons, with cunning, spiteful faces,
and mock crowns on their heads.</p>

    <div class="caption">Türbeh of the Mosque Shabzadeh.</div></div>

<p>The great glass cases in which all these worthies
are enclosed lend something of the look of an anatomical
museum to the place, and increase their
likeness to mummified human beings, so that from
time to time you are conscious of a disagreeable
creeping sensation down your backbone, or feel as
though you might just have passed through a room
of the Old Seraglio in the presence of the entire
court whom some threatening outburst from the
Pâdishah has frozen stiff with terror. When you at
last come out upon the square of the At-Meidan,
and your eye falls upon pashas clad all in sombre
black, and nizams modestly attired in the uniform of
zouaves, oh how gentle, amiable, almost timid, does
the Turk of our day and generation appear!</p>

    <div class="caption">Tombs of Sultan Mahmûd II and of his Son, Abdul Aziz.</div></div>

<p>An irresistible attraction calls me back once more
among the tombs: this time it is those numberless
imperial türbehs scattered throughout the Turkish
city, those charming examples of the Mussulman’s
art and philosophy, which occupy so conspicuous a
place in our recollections of the East. By means of
a firman we gained admission, first of all, to the
türbeh of Mahmûd the Reformer, which stands in a
garden full of roses and jasmine not far from the At-Meidan.
It is a beautiful circular building of white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
marble, whose leaden dome is supported upon Ionic
pilasters:<a id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">K</a> there are seven windows, furnished with
gilded gratings, some of which overlook one of the
principal streets of Stambul. Inside, the walls are
ornamented with bas-reliefs and covered with silken
and brocade hangings. In the centre stands the
tomb, covered with costly Persian shawls, and lying
on it is the imperial fez, emblem of reform, with its
plume and diamond aigrette, and within the enclosure,
which is surrounded by a graceful railing inlaid
with mother-of-pearl, are placed four massive silver
candlesticks. The tombs of seven sultans stand
along the walls; costly rugs and carpets of many
hues cover the pavement; and here and there rare
MSS. copies of the Koran with gold lettering lie
upon rich reading-desks. A silver case contains a
curiosity connected with Mahmûd’s youth, which he
directed should be placed on his tomb at his
death. It consists of a long strip of muslin covered
with minute Arabian characters, extracts from the
Koran, which with infinite patience the Sultan traced
when he was confined as a prisoner in the Old
Seraglio before his accession. From the interior of
the türbeh glimpses are caught through the window
gratings of branches of trees without, the
scent of roses pours in, and the little building is
filled with light and the stir and movement of the
city, as though it were an open gallery. Women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and children pause as they go by to look through the
windows and murmur a prayer. There is something
primitive and very sweet about it all that touches
the heart, as though, not the skeleton, but the soul
of the dead sultan lay within those walls, listening to
his people who greet him in passing; in dying he
has merely exchanged his kiosk in the Seraglio for
this one, which is no less cheerful than the other;
he is still in the sunlight, in the noise and bustle of
Stambul; still among his children&mdash;nearer to them,
indeed, than before; just on the edge of life and
in sight of all; still exhibiting before their eyes
his plume glittering as it was ever wont to do
when he appeared before them, glowing with life
and magnificence, on his way to the mosque to
pray for the prosperity of the empire. And it is the
same with all the other türbehs&mdash;that of Ahmed, of
Bayezid (whose head rests upon a brick made of
the dust collected from his clothing and slippers),
of Suleiman, of Mustafa, and Selim III., of Abdul-Hamid,
and of Roxalana: they are small temples
whose pillars are of white marble and porphyry, and
which glitter with amber and mother-of-pearl. Some
of them have openings in the roof through which the
rain falls upon the flowers and turf which surround
the tombs, all hung with lace and velvet; ostrich
eggs and gilded lamps hang from the roofs, lighting
up the tombs of the various princes which encircle the
paternal sarcophagus, and on them are exposed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
handkerchiefs which were used to strangle infants
and little children, possibly with a view to impressing
upon the minds of the faithful, together with a natural
sense of pity for the victims, the fatal necessity
for such crimes. I well remember how I, myself,
by force of constantly picturing such deaths as
these, began at last to be conscious of a certain acquiescence,
in my own mind, with the iniquitous
reasons of state which sanctioned them&mdash;how by
dint of seeing ever before me in mosques and fountains
and türbehs, and under every conceivable form,
the glorification and worship of one man, of one absolute
and supreme power, something within me too
began to yield itself up to that power; and how, at
last, after wandering very frequently in the shaded
cemeteries and fixing my attention for long periods
on tombs and sepulchres, I came to regard death in
a new and much more tranquil light, to experience a
certain indifference toward life, and to drift half unconsciously
into a state of sluggish philosophy and
vague indifference, in which the highest good
seemed to consist in dreaming away one’s life, allowing
what is written to be accomplished without
let or hindrance. And thus it came about that I
found myself, quite unexpectedly, seized with a feeling
of weariness and aversion when, in the midst of
these peaceful reveries, something would recall to my
mind our toiling cities, our dark churches, and
walled and dreary cemeteries.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Dervishes.</span></h3>

<p>I am reminded, too, of the dervishes when I recall
those last days.</p>

<p>The Mevlevi&mdash;or dancing dervishes (the most celebrated
of the thirty-two orders)&mdash;have a well-known
fekkeh on the Grande Rue de Pera. We proceeded
thither prepared to behold rapt, saintly countenances
lit up by celestial visions. But our minds
were quickly disabused of all such ideas. Alas!
among dervishes as well the flame of faith “laps a
dry wick,” and the celebrated holy dance appeared
to me to be nothing more than a cold and formal
theatrical performance. It is unquestionably both
curious and interesting to watch them as they enter
the circular mosque in single file, each one enveloped
in a long dark mantle, with arms concealed
and head bowed, to an accompaniment of savage
music, monotonous and sweet, which resembles the
sound made by the wind among the cypress trees of
the Skutari cemetery, soothing one into a sort of
waking slumber. And when they begin to turn,
prostrating themselves two by two before the mihrab
with dreamy, languid movements which arouse
sudden doubts as to their sex: there is something
fascinating too in the way in which, with a sudden
rapid movement, they fling aside their cloaks and
appear all in white, with long woollen skirts, and,
opening their arms with an amorous gesture and inclining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
their heads to one side, abandon themselves
one after another to the evolutions of the dance, as
though pushed forward by an invisible hand, and
when they all whirl around in the centre of the
mosque together and at equal distances from one
another, without diverging from their respective
posts by so much as a hair’s breadth, as though each
one were on a pivot, white, rapid, light, with waving,
inflated skirts and half-closed eyes; and when
with a sudden simultaneous movement, as though
overpowered by some superhuman vision, they cast
themselves upon the ground with a thundering cry
of “Allah!” or when, commencing again, they bend
low and kiss one another’s hands, then circle around
once more, close to the wall, with a light, tripping
step, between walking and dancing,&mdash;all of this, I
acknowledge, makes a beautiful and entertaining
performance, but the ecstasies, the transports, the
transfigured faces, seen and described by so many
enthusiastic travellers, I failed to discover. All I
saw was a number of extraordinarily agile and indefatigable
dancers, who went through their task with
the most utter indifference, sometimes even with
suppressed smiles. One young dervish was manifestly
pleased at finding himself observed by an
English girl in the gallery just opposite him, and I
detected more than one in an attempt to bite instead
of kiss his neighbor’s proffered hand, the other retaliating
with a sharp pinch&mdash;the hypocrites! What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
struck me most was that every one of those men&mdash;and
they were of all ages and conditions&mdash;possessed
a grace and elegance of movement and pose which
might well arouse envy in the breasts of many
of the frequenters of our ball-rooms, and which I
take to be a natural attribute of the Oriental races,
due, no doubt, to certain peculiarities in their structure
and build. I had an opportunity of observing
this still more closely on another occasion, when I
visited one of them in his cell just at the hour when
he was preparing to take part in the dance. He was
a tall, slender youth, with a beardless and somewhat
effeminate face: when we entered he was standing
before a mirror in the act of fastening on his white
cassock. Greeting us with a smiling glance, he
continued his toilet, passing his hand lightly over his
slim figure, adjusting rapidly, but at the same time
tastefully and with the sure eye of an artist, all the
various parts of his costume, just as a lady gives
the finishing touches to her dress; and, really seen
from behind with his trailing gown, he did look very
much indeed like a pretty slip of a girl who, all
dressed for the ball, gazes in the mirror to judge of
the effect. And he was&mdash;a monk!</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But among all my last memories there are none so
beautiful as those of the summit of Mount Chamlejah,
which rises up above Skutari. It was there
that I gave Constantinople my final greeting, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
as it was the last, so was it also the most superb of
all my great visions of the metropolis. We crossed
ever to Skutari at daybreak one foggy morning:
when we arrived at the top of the mountain the fog
was still there, and, though the appearance of the
sky gave promise of a clear day, everything below
us was hidden. It was an extraordinary sight. An
immense gray curtain was spread between us and
Skutari, the Bosphorus, the Golden Horn, all of
Constantinople, completely concealing them, just
as though the great city with its harbors and outskirts
had been blotted out of existence. It was like
an ocean of mist, from out of which the summit of
Chamlejah arose like a lonely island. As we gazed
down at the gray sea at our feet we pretended that
we were two poor pilgrims from the interior of Asia
Minor, who, having reached that spot before daybreak,
were looking at the mist below them without
any idea that it covered the mighty metropolis of the
Ottoman empire; and then we amused ourselves
greatly by picturing what their growing sensations
of wonder and bewilderment would have been as,
little by little, the rising sun rolled back the veil
and exposed the marvellous and unlooked-for spectacle
to view. The thick clouds began to break
away at various points at the same moment; here
and there on the great gray surface little groups of
houses appeared like tiny islands&mdash;an archipelago of
small towns, floating in the mist and scattered far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
away from one another. These were the peaks of
Stambul’s seven hills, the heights of Pera, the highest
villages along the European shore of the Bosphorus,
the crest of Kassim Pasha, a confused suggestion of
the more distant suburbs along the Golden Horn
near Eyûb and Haskeui&mdash;twenty little Constantinoples,
rosy, airy, bristling with innumerable white,
green, and silver points. Then each began to grow
larger and larger, as though slowly arising from that
vaporous sea, and on all sides thousands of roofs,
domes, towers, and minarets floated gayly into sight,
crowding close together or chasing after one another
as though each were skurrying to take his place
before being caught by the sun. Already Skutari
lay exposed to view, as well as nearly all of Stambul;
on the other bank of the Golden Horn we could
see the higher parts of all those outskirts which
stretch from Galata to the Sweet Waters; and on
the European shore of the Bosphorus, Topkâneh,
Fundukli, Dolmabâghcheh, Beshiktash, and so on,
as far as the eye could reach, village after village,
great tiers of buildings, and still more distant towns,
of which only the roofs could be seen, bathed in a
soft pink glow. But the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus,
the sea were still invisible. Our two pilgrims
would have been completely puzzled: apparently
it was an immense city built above two
deep valleys, perpetually enveloped in fog, one
opening into the other; and they might well have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
wondered what those two mysterious abysses could
possibly contain. But, behold! Yet a few moments
and the dull gray of the remaining clouds begins to
melt into blue; then a shimmer appears. Water?
a bay? No, a strait, a sea, two seas! All of Constantinople
at length stands forth revealed, bathed in
light, framed in blue and green, looking as though
she might just have left the hands of the Creator.
Oh the beautiful vision! What avails it that
we have already gazed enraptured upon you from a
hundred different heights, examined your every minutest
detail, and given voice over and over again
to our wonder and admiration? Once more we must
engage in the vain struggle to express our sense of
your all-inexpressible loveliness; and this time it is
with the knowledge that yet a few short days and
you are destined to fade for ever from our eyes,
henceforth to be only a vague, confused memory;
the veil of mist will settle down, to lift again no
more for ever; the moment of parting is at hand.
I know not why, but it is as though we were going
into exile, and the horizon of our lives seems to
grow indistinct.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And yet even in Constantinople, and when there
are only a few days left, one is sometimes bored.
The mind, completely wearied out, refuses to receive
any more new impressions. We would cross
the bridge without turning our heads: everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
seemed to be the same color; we wandered aimlessly
about, yawning and uninterested like a couple
of idle vagabonds; spent hour after hour sitting in
front of a Turkish café staring at the ground, or
lounging at the hotel windows watching the cats
climb over the opposite roofs. We were satiated
with the Orient, and felt within us a growing desire
for work and activity.</p>

<div id="if_i_20" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="600" height="459" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Coffee-Maker.</div></div>

<p>Then came two days of steady rain. Constantinople
became one huge mud-puddle and turned gray
all over. That was the final stroke. We plunged
head foremost into outrageously bad humors, abused
the whole place, grew rude and stupid, and assumed
no end of conceited European airs. Who on the
day of our arrival would ever have imagined such
a condition of things? And to think of the lengths
to which it carried us!&mdash;actually to the point of
holding high festival on the day when we came
out of the Austrian Lloyds with a couple of tickets
for Varna and the Danube in our pockets! But
there was one feature that dampened our rejoicings,
and that was the approaching parting from our kind
friends in Pera, with whom we passed all our last
evenings in the most cordial and friendly fashion.
How depressing this everlasting saying good-bye
becomes&mdash;this continual breaking of pleasant ties,
and leaving a fragment of one’s heart wherever one
may go! Is there nowhere to be found on the surface
of the earth a magic wand by whose aid I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
one day be enabled, at a given moment, to assemble
around some well-spread board all my friends scattered
at present over the surface of the globe&mdash;you,
Santoro, from Constantinople; you, Selam, from the
coast of Africa; and Ten Brink from the dunes of
Holland; and Segovia from the Guadalquivir; and
Saavedra from the banks of the Thames&mdash;that I
may tell you how ever-present you all are in my
thoughts and in my heart? Alas! the wand is not
yet found, and in the mean time the years go by and
one’s dreams fade away.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_6">THE TURKS.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_248">248</a><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
And now, before embarking upon that Austrian
boat which is getting up steam in the Golden Horn
opposite Galata, preparatory to sailing for the Black
Sea, it remains for me to set forth, modestly as
becomes a simple traveller, certain general observations
bearing upon the question, “What did you
think of the Turks?”&mdash;observations altogether spontaneous
in themselves, and wholly uninfluenced by
current events, resting, in short, entirely upon
my personal recollections of those days. At that
question, “What did you think of the Turks?” the
first thing that comes into my mind is the impression
made upon me from the moment I set foot in Constantinople
to the last day of my stay there by the
outward appearance of the male population of Stambul.
Setting aside all merely physical differences,
this impression is something altogether unlike that
produced upon one by the men of any other city
of Europe: it is as though they were all&mdash;I am at
a loss how to express my meaning more clearly&mdash;thinking
of precisely the same thing. Now, this
idea might occur to a Southerner as he observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
superficially and for the first time the inhabitants
of a city of Northern Europe, but that is not the
same thing at all. With them it is the seriousness
and preoccupation of a busy people who are thinking
of actual things, while the Turks all seem to be
considering something intangible and remote: they
have the air of philosophers possessed by a fixed
idea, or of somnambulists unconscious of their
whereabouts, gazing ahead of them with far-seeing
eyes, as though accustomed to contemplate distant
horizons, while in the expression of the eyes and
lines of the mouth there is that look of vague
melancholy noticeable in people who live shut up
in themselves. In all there is the same gravity,
the same composed manner, the same reserve of
language, look, and gesture. They seem all to
be gentlemen educated after one pattern, from the
pasha to the shopkeeper, and animated in common
by a certain well-bred dignity, which, wore it not
for the differences in dress, would lead one to suppose
that Stambul had no plebeians. The expression
is almost universally cold, revealing nothing
of the soul and mind within, it being exceedingly
rare to come across one of those open countenances
so common among us which reflect, like mirrors,
the passionate or loving or spiteful nature below,
and lend themselves to a quick and accurate reading
of the man. Among the Turks, on the contrary,
every face is an enigma; their look interrogates, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
never responds, and their mouths betray nothing of
the impulses of the heart within. It is impossible to
convey any idea of the depressing effect made upon
a stranger by these expressionless faces, this coldness,
this statuesque uniformity of attitude and bearing,
and the steady, passionless gaze which seems to
see nothing. Sometimes you are seized with an
insane desire to shout aloud in the middle of the
crowd: “Rouse yourselves just once&mdash;wake up,
speak out, tell what you are thinking of, what you
are, what you see, staring ahead of you, with those
great glass eyes!” At first it seems all so unnatural
that you cannot realize that it is a normal condition,
and fancy that this manner must have been assumed
by common consent, or else result from some moral
malady by which all the Mussulmans are temporarily
afflicted. There is a variation, though, and a remarkable
one, in the general uniformity, which
strikes you at once: the original physical traits
of the Turkish race&mdash;a race both handsome and
robust&mdash;are now preserved only by that portion
of the population which, either from necessity or
religious enthusiasm, follows the same simple and
austere manner of life as their forefathers did.
Their characteristics are&mdash;a spare, vigorous build,
well-formed head, bright eyes, aquiline nose,
prominent jawbone, and general air of activity and
strength. The Turk of the upper classes, on the
contrary, where vice has long prevailed and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
mixing of alien blood is much more common, has
usually a fat, overgrown body, small head, low
forehead, dull eyes, and drooping lips. A correspondingly
great, or even greater, moral divergence
exists between the true, pure Turk of a former
generation and that colorless nondescript being
calling himself “a reformed Turk.” Hence, any
one who may desire to study the characteristics of
what may, in general terms, be called the Turkish
people, is confronted by a serious difficulty at the
outset, since with that half of it which has preserved
intact the national traits there is either no way of
mixing or no medium of communication, while the
other half, while they offer every facility for intercourse
and observation, do not faithfully represent
either the national character or aims. Neither corruption
nor the modern coloring of European civilization,
however, has yet deprived the upper-class
Turk of that indefinable air, at once severe and
melancholy, which is seen in the lower classes as
well, and which, not considered individually, but in
the general mass of the people, produces an undeniably
favorable impression. In fact, judging only from
appearances, one would be inclined to pronounce the
Turkish population the most civilized and well-behaved
of any city in Europe. Even in the most
deserted quarters of Stambul a stranger never is
in danger of being insulted: he may frequent the
mosques, even during the hours of prayer, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
much greater certainty of meeting with respectful
treatment than if he were a Turk visiting one of
our churches; one never encounters a look that is,
not insolent,&mdash;but so much as disagreeably curious;
in the crowded streets it is rare to hear a laugh,
and very rare to see a street-row in which blows are
given and received; there are no bold glances from
women at doors or windows or in the shops, no open
indecency. The market-place is but little less dignified
than the mosque, and everywhere the utmost
restraint is put upon both language and gesture&mdash;no
singing, no loud laughter, no vulgar scuffling, no
importunate rabble blocking up the way; clean
faces, hands, and feet; rarely is any one to be seen
ragged, still more rarely dirty; there is no brawling,
and a universal and reciprocal respect exists between
all classes of society.</p>

<p>But all this is merely what appears upon the surface;
the dry rot is covered up; the separation of
the sexes prevents the corruption from being apparent.
Sloth wears the mask of leisure, dignity
is a cloak for pride. That well-bred composure
which seems to indicate a thoughtful nature hides in
reality a mortal intellectual inertia; what appears to
be sombre moderation in their manner of life is
nothing in the world but an utter absence of any
life at all. The character and philosophy, the entire
life, of this people may be understood by a particular
condition of the body and spirit called <i>kief</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
represents their ideal of supreme happiness. This
is it, after partaking sparingly of food, drinking a
glass of water from the fountain, and saying some
prayers, to establish yourself, with the body thus
satisfied and the conscience at ease, in some spot
from whence a wide stretch of the horizon may be
seen, and there, beneath the shade of a tree, to remain,
following the movements of the pigeons in the
opposite cemetery, the distant ships, the insects close
at hand, the clouds in the sky, and the smoke from
your narghileh, reflecting the while vaguely on God
and death, on the vanity of earthly things, and the
sweetness of the eternal repose and the other life.
That is <i>kief</i>; in other words, to be an idle spectator
in the world’s great theatre is the Turk’s most lofty
aspiration toward which he is impelled by the originally
pastoral temperament of his race, at once slow
and contemplative, his religion, which ties men’s
hands in committing all to God, and his traditions as
a soldier of Islamism for whom there exists no other
really great or necessary sphere of action but that
of the battlefield, upon which he must gain the
mastery for his own faith; that done, every duty
has been performed. His point of view is that of
the fatalist: man is merely an instrument in the
hands of Providence, and it is quite useless for him
to attempt to alter the course of events as it has been
prescribed in heaven; this world is but a caravansary,
through which man has been created by God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
to pass, praying and admiring His works: leave all
to God; let what is dying, die, what is passing away,
pass; why should we trouble ourselves to restore or
preserve? The supreme desire of the Turk is for
peace, and he protects himself with the utmost care
from all that threatens the calm monotony of his existence;
consequently, no thirst for knowledge disturbs
him, no passion for gain, no vague, unsatisfied
longings either of love or ambition. The utter absence
of those innumerable intellectual and physical
tastes, in order to satisfy which we are willing to
labor so incessantly, prevents him from being able
to so much as understand why we do it, and he sees
in it only an indication of a morbid aberration of mind.
The final aim of all endeavor being, in his judgment,
the attainment of that peace which he enjoys without
being at any trouble to obtain, it seems to him
self-evident that his course is the most sensible. The
most stupendous intellectual and physical achievements
of the other European nations seem to him
nothing more than the results of a puerile restlessness,
since they fail to gain for them an increased
possession of his ideal of happiness. Never working
himself, he has no sense of the value of time,
and so neither desires nor appreciates all those fruits
of human ingenuity which tend to quicken and facilitate
the progress of the human race: he is quite
capable of questioning the benefits to be derived
from a railroad unless it could transport you to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
place where you would be happier than you were
before. This fatalistic belief, which leads him to
condemn as useless any taking of thought for the
future, is the cause of his utter disregard of everything
apart from the certain and immediate advantage
it may bring him. Thus a European who looks
ahead and plans and schemes, and lays the foundations
of enterprises whose completion he cannot hope
to see, exhausting his powers and sacrificing his ease
for a distant and uncertain end, he regards in the
light of a visionary. We seem to him to be a frivolous
people, despicable, presumptuous, degenerate,
whose only boast lies in a sort of science of those
earthly things which he scorns just as far as he is
able to without allowing them to get the better of
him. And how he despises us! For my own part,
I am convinced that this is the ruling sentiment with
which we inspire those real Turks who still constitute
the large majority of the nation: one may deny or
pretend not to believe this, but any one who has
lived among them more or less cannot fail to be conscious
of it. This feeling of disdain comes from
various causes: first of all&mdash;and this, from their
standpoint, is a most significant circumstance&mdash;they
have maintained their supremacy over a large tract
of Europe, whose population is of a different faith
from their own, for more than four centuries, notwithstanding
their comparatively small numbers and
in the teeth of all that has happened and is still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
happening. To a small number of Turks this is
merely to be attributed to the rival jealousies and
discords of the great European powers, but the rest
of the nation see in it only additional proof of their
own superiority and our degradation. Indeed, it has
never entered the mind of a Turk of the lower
orders that Islam Europe ever could or would submit
to the affront of Christian conquest from the
Dardanelles to the Danube. To the boasts of our
civilization they oppose the fact of their dominion.
Naturally haughty, their pride fed and strengthened
by the habit of ruling, accustomed to being assured
in the name of God that they belong to a race of
conquerors, born to fight, but not to work, and wont
to subsist off the labors of the vanquished, they cannot
so much as take in the idea that the people subdued
by their arms could ever lay claim to the right
of civil equality with themselves. Possessed as they
are by a blind faith in the visible overrulings of
Providence, their conquest of Europe was but a fulfilment
of the will of God, and it is God who invested
them, as a mark of His power, with this
earthly sovereignty. The fact of His continuing to
maintain them in it in the face of so many hostile
forces is an incontestable proof of their divine
right and of the truth of their religion. Against
this line of argument the claims of civilization for
human rights and equality are urged in vain. For
them civilization means nothing but a hostile force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
which is trying to disarm them without coming to an
open fight: little by little, and stealthily, it would
lower them in the estimation of their own subjects
and steal away their ascendency. So, in addition to
despising it as a vain thing, they fear it as an enemy,
and, unable to oppose it by force, they offer the resistance
of their own invincible inertia. To be transformed,
civilized, is to put themselves on an equality
with the people they have conquered, to endeavor to
emulate them in intellectual achievements, study,
work, acquire a new superiority, win again, this time
with the mind, the victory already gained by their
swords. To such an enterprise as this is opposed,
apart from their natural interests as rulers, their religious
contempt for unbelievers, their military pride,
their indolence, which is second nature, and the character
of their intellect, entirely wanting as it is in
the creative faculty and dulled and blunted by the
continued iteration of those same few ideas which
form the entire intellectual patrimony of their nation.
Moreover, those among themselves who have
adopted what they are pleased to call European
civilization, and represent the state to which they
believe Europe would like to see all the sons of Osman
brought,&mdash;those of their brethren who wear
long coats and gloves and chatter French and neglect
the mosque, hardly set such an example as
might reasonably be expected to convert the others.
In what way has the so-called civilization affected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
them? On this point at least there is little difference
of opinion: the new Turk is not worth as much as
the old; he has adopted our dress, our conveniences,
our vices, and our vanity, but thus far neither our
beliefs nor our ideas, and has succeeded, moreover,
in the course of this partial transformation, in losing
whatever good points he may once have possessed in
the depths of his genuine Ottoman nature. Thus far,
the only fruits of civilization evident to the conservative
Turk is a more widely diffused <i>peste dicasterica</i>,
an innumerable host of idle, inefficient, discreditable,
rapacious officials, wearing the mask of Europeans
and despising all the ancient traditions of the nation,
and a sort of <i>jeunesse dorée</i>, corrupt and shameless,
who give promise of being many degrees worse than
their fathers were. To live and dress as they do is,
in the opinion of the real Turk, to be civilized, and
as a matter of fact he calls it doing or thinking or
living, as the case may be, like the Frank whenever
it is a question of anything which not only the conscience
of a strict Mohammedan would condemn, but
that of any decent man of whatever religion. And
so the “uncivilized,” instead of looking upon these
others as enlightened Mussulmans who have gained
certain advantages in advance of their fellow-countrymen,
regard them as degenerate beings, led astray,
hardly less than apostates, traitors to the nation; and
they fear and resist everything like change with all
the force they possess, if for no other reason than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
because it proceeds from that quarter where its fatal
results are daily before their eyes. Every European
innovation means to them simply a fresh attempt
upon their national life and interests. The government
is revolutionary, the people conservative; the
seed of the new ideas falls upon a dry, compact soil,
which refuses to yield up the necessary moisture for
its nutriment; he who rules the nation’s affairs
draws and manipulates the hilt, but the blade merely
spins around in the haft. That is why all those
efforts at reform which have been started during the
past fifty years have never penetrated farther than
the national skin; if in some instances names have
been changed, the things have remained the same.
What little has been accomplished has been by force,
and at its door the people lay the increasing audacity
of the unbelievers, the corruption which is eating
away the heart of the empire, and all the national
misfortunes. Why, they ask, should we change our
institutions, since they are the same with which we
have prevailed against and overcome our enemies
for centuries? Why adopt those of the people who
were unable to withstand the power of our sword?
The organism, life, and traditions of the Turkish
people are like those of a victorious army encamped
upon European soil, enjoying the idleness and privileges,
wielding the authority, and exhibiting the
pride of conquerors, and, like all armies, they prefer
that iron discipline which accords the pre-eminence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to them over the vanquished, to a milder rule which
would restrict their arbitrary rights. Now, the idea
that this state of things, which has existed unchanged
for centuries, can be altered in the course of a few
years is simply an idle dream. The light vanguard
of the “civilized” may march ahead as rapidly as
they choose, but the body of the army, laden still
with the ponderous armor of mediæval times, either
remains stationary or else follows at a great distance
and with hardly perceptible steps.</p>

<p>Blind despotism, the corps of the Janissaries, the
Seraglio adorned with human heads, a firm belief in
the invincibility of the Osman dynasty, the <i>rayâh</i>
regarded as an unclean being, the French ambassadors
dressed and fed at the confines of the throne-room
to symbolize the miserable poverty of the
unbeliever in the eyes of the supreme lord,&mdash;all of
these, it must be remembered, are but things of
yesterday, and, as a matter of fact, I suppose there
is not much divergence of opinion on this head,
even between Europeans and the Turks themselves:
that about which there is the greatest disagreement,
and consequently great difficulty for a stranger who
wishes to arrive at a correct judgement, is the estimation
in which the private and personal characteristics
of the individual Turk is held. If you question
a <i>rayâh</i>, you hear only the complaints of the
oppressed against the oppressor, while from the free
European colonists, who have no cause either to dislike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
or fear the Ottomans, but, on the contrary, every
reason for congratulating themselves on the existing
condition of things, you get nothing, as a rule, but
opinions which are possibly sincere, but certainly
are excessively favorable. The majority of these
last agree in pronouncing the Turk to be frank, loyal,
honest, and sincerely religious; but in crediting him
with this sentiment of religion, it must always be
borne in mind that the faith which he upholds so
loyally does not interfere with any one of his tastes
or interests; in fact, it caters to his sensual nature,
justifies his indolence, upholds his rule: he clings
to it tenaciously because his national life is in its
dogmas and upon belief in it depends his fate. With
regard to his probity, many individual cases are
brought forward of the same kind as hundreds of
others which might be cited with equal force about
the most corrupt peoples of Europe; and it must be
remembered in this connection that the Turk in his
dealings with Christians often assumes a sort of
ostentatious honesty, acting, out of sheer pride, in
a manner which he would never dream of doing if
he were influenced by his conscience alone; he
simply cannot bear to appear of small account in
the eyes of those whom he considers his inferiors
both in race and in moral worth. Hence his attitude
as a ruler gives birth to certain characteristics,
praiseworthy enough in the abstract, such as
frankness, pride, and dignity, but which he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
certainly never have developed had he been subjected
to the same conditions as the people under
his sway. At the same time, though, he undoubtedly
possesses some admirable qualities, such, for instance,
as liberality in the giving of alms, which, even
though it does encourage sloth and thus add to the
general wretchedness, constitutes almost the sole
alleviation for the innumerable miseries of his ill-ordered
society; and he has other traits indicative
of a kindly spirit, such as his undying gratitude
for the smallest act of kindness, his reverence for
the dead, his cordial hospitality, and his gentleness
toward animals; then his attitude in regard to the
equality of all classes of society is admirable, and
there is no denying that there is a sort of severe
moderation in his character, which crops out in innumerable
proverbs full of wisdom and sagacity; a
certain patriarchal simplicity, a dreamy love of solitude,
and a vague melancholy which tend to rid the
soul of vulgarity and vice. All these qualities float,
as it were, on the surface as long as the tranquillity
of his ordinary life remains undisturbed, but below
them sleep his violent Asiatic nature, his fanaticism,
his warlike ardor, and barbarous ferocity, ready to
blaze forth and transform him into another being.
Thus the saying that the Turk is the most amiable
of men except when he cuts off people’s heads is
really quite correct. The Tartar, chained and sleeping,
is in him still, and his natural vigor too, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
preserved than otherwise by the slothful ease of his
habit of life, which only makes demands upon it at
some great crisis. He has preserved his physical
courage intact, not having loosened its springs by
the cultivation of the intellect, which raises the
value of human life and makes men less willing to
throw it away, as it offers them more to live for.
In him the sentiment both of religion and warfare
finds a field unspoiled by doubts or the spirit of
rebellion or clashing beliefs; it is a soil which can
be instantly set fire to&mdash;a man cut out of a single
block, who needs but a touch to unsheathe his sword
and strike out in all directions, while upon its blade
is inscribed the name of but one God and one
sovereign. Social life has worked but very little
change in him from the ancient inhabitant of the
steppe and hut: in the city he still leads, in spirit,
much the same sort of life as he formerly led among
his tribe&mdash;surrounded, that is, by people, but alone
with his thoughts. And there is really no social life
among the Turks. The existence of the two sexes
suggests the idea of two rivers which run parallel
to one another, their waters never mingling except
here and there in some subterranean passage-way.
The men meet together, but there is no actual intimacy
between them; they approach, but obtain no
hold on one another, each one preferring what a
great poet has called the <i>vegetazione sorda delle idee</i>
to the expansion of himself. Our conversations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
rapid, varied, playful, instructive, or humorous, our
demand for the interchange of ideas, for human
intercourse, for the spur to our intellects and warmth
for our hearts which are obtained by association with
others, are hardly known among them. Their discourse
is all of earthly things, comprehending only
the material necessities of life; love is excluded
from it, literature is the privilege of the few, science
is a myth, politics but little more than a question of
names, and business occupies but a very small place
in the lives of most of them. The nature of their
intellect prohibits discussions upon abstract topics,
as they can only grasp clearly the idea of such
things as they are able to see and touch, their language
itself giving proof of this in its inability to express
an abstraction. When such a necessity arises
the learned Turk has recourse to the Arabic or Persian
or some European language. They see, moreover,
no necessity for making any mental effort in order
to understand what lies outside their own immediate
sphere: the Persian is inquiring, the Arabian curious.
As for the Turk, he experiences only the most
supreme indifference toward all he does not know,
and, as he has no ideas to interchange, he naturally
does not care for the society of Europeans, disliking
their interminable and subtle discussions, and, still
more, themselves. There cannot, in the nature of
things, be anything like confidence between them,
since the Turk resolutely keeps back all that part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
of himself which relates to his household, his pleasures,
his closest ties, and, what is still more important,
the real nature of his feeling for the other,
which is nothing less than an invincible distrust.
He tolerates the Armenian, despises the Jew, hates
the Greek, distrusts the Frank. Generally speaking,
he puts up with them all in much the same
spirit that a big animal will allow a swarm of flies
to alight on his back, contenting himself with giving
an occasional sweep with his tail when they begin
to sting; he lets them interfere and change his surroundings
as much as they want to; knows how to
value those Europeans who can be of use to him;
accepts such innovations in material things as can
offer some palpable advantage; listens without a
tremor of the eyelid to all the lectures on civilization
which are read to him; alters laws, customs, and
ceremonials, learns by heart and repeats fluently the
sayings of our philosophers; allows himself to be
travestied, caricatured, burlesqued; but at bottom
he remains immutably, hopelessly the same.</p>

<p>And yet reason refuses to believe that the slow
onward march of civilization will not eventually
succeed in implanting a spark of new life in this
gigantic Asiatic soldier who lies sprawling fast asleep
across two continents, only arousing to brandish the
sword. But when we consider the efforts which
have been made as compared with the results obtained
up to the present time, that day appears to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
so very distant, especially in view of the needs and
the impatience of the Christian population of the
East, that it seems vain to hope that the question
which is occupying the mind of all Europe can have
for its solution the progressive and orderly civilization
of the Turkish people. Such, at all events, is
the conclusion arrived at by me in the course of my
brief sojourn in Constantinople. What other solution
is there? Ah, gentlemen, that is a question
which you must really excuse me if I decline to answer.
Were I to do so, it would seem as though I
were giving advice to Europe, an idea which shocks
my modesty. And, moreover, as I have already
mentioned, there is a certain Austrian boat getting
up steam down there in the Golden Horn off Galata,
which is ready to start for the Black Sea, and the
reader knows very well what that boat is going to
pass through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="hidev" id="Page_270">270</a><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Hardly were we well on board when a gray curtain
seemed to stretch itself over Constantinople,
upon which were portrayed the outlines of the Morravian
and Hungarian Mountains and the Alps of
Lower Austria. Such rapid changes of scene occur
not infrequently upon the decks of outgoing steamers,
where one is apt to recognize the features and hear beforehand
the language of the country for which he is
bound. On this occasion we found ourselves hemmed
in by a circle of German faces and felt a premonitory
breath of the cold and dampness of the North. Our
friends have left us. Three white handkerchiefs
fluttering from a distant käik show where they are
threading their way through the dark mass of boats
coming and going in front of the custom-house.
We are in the same spot as that in which our Sicilian
boat anchored on the day of our arrival. It is a
lovely autumnal evening, clear and warm, and Constantinople
has never appeared so vast nor so radiantly
beautiful. Yet once again we endeavor to
imprint upon our memories her mighty outlines, her
matchless coloring, like that of an enchanted city,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and for the last time drink in the unutterable
beauties of the Golden Horn, so soon to be for ever
hidden from our gaze. Now the white handkerchiefs
have disappeared and our boat is in motion. Everything
seems to have moved out of place: Skutari
has come forward, Stambul stepped back, while Galata
revolves around in a circle as though trying to
see the last of us. Farewell to the Golden Horn!
One forward bound of the vessel robs us of Kassim-Pasha,
another carries off Eyûb, another the sixth
hill of Stambul; then the fifth disappears, the fourth
is hidden, the third vanishes, the second fades away;
only the Seraglio Hill is left, and that&mdash;Heaven be
praised!&mdash;will still remain to us for a little longer at
least. Already we are in mid stream, advancing
rapidly up the Bosphorus; Topkhâneh flies by, then
Fundukli, then the white and sculptured façades of
Dolmabâghcheh; Skutari presents to us for the last
time her amphitheatre of hills covered with gardens
and villas.</p>

<p>Farewell, Constantinople, vast and dearly-loved
city, dream of my childhood, desire of my youth,
and unfading memory of my life! Farewell, exquisite
and immortal queen of the Orient! May
time soften thy lot without impairing thy beauty,
and may my children one day greet thee with the
same ecstasy of youthful enthusiasm with which I
bid thee farewell!</p>

<p>The sadness of parting was, however, soon forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
in the delight of finding a new Constantinople,
even larger and more exquisitely lovely than the one
we had left upon the banks of the Golden Horn, extending
for about sixteen miles along the two most
beautiful shores on earth.</p>

<p>The first village to come into sight upon our left&mdash;that
is, upon the European shore&mdash;is Beshiktash, a
large Turkish suburb of Constantinople, lying at the
foot of a hill and enclosing a small harbor; behind
it a charming valley&mdash;the ancient valley of the <i>allori
di Stefano</i> of Byzantium&mdash;ascends in the direction of
Pera; a group of plane trees rising in the midst of
the houses marks the sepulchre of the famous corsair
Barbarossa; and a large café, always crowded,
extends out over the water supported on piles; the
harbor is gay with käiks and other boats, the
shore covered with people, the hillsides with verdure,
and the valley filled with houses and gardens;
but it is no longer like a suburb of Constantinople:
already we note the distinctive character, the matchless
radiance and charm peculiar to the villages along
the Bosphorus; the objects are smaller, the foliage
thicker, the coloring more brilliant: it is like a nest
of smiling little houses suspended between sky and
water, a tiny city inhabited by lovers and poets, only
designed to last as long as the fires of passion or
genius may burn, and placed there to gratify a whim
on some fair summer’s night. Hardly have our eyes
rested well upon it than it is already gone, and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
find ourselves opposite the Cheragan palace, or
rather row of white marble palaces, at once chaste
and magnificent, adorned with long lines of columns
and crowned with terraces and balconies, above
which floats an airy cloud of innumerable white
birds of the Bosphorus, standing out clearly against
the brilliant foliage of the hillsides.</p>

<p>But now a most tantalizing experience begins.
While our attention is concentrated upon one
beautiful sight we are missing a thousand others.
While we stand gazing at Beshiktash and Cheragan,
the Asiatic shore, whose charming villages tempt one
to buy and carry them off like jewels, is flying by.
Kuzgunjik disappears, tinted with every color of the
rainbow, where tradition says the heifer Io landed
after swimming the Bosphorus in order to escape
from the gad-flies of Hera; and Istavros, with its
beautiful mosque and two minarets; and the imperial
palace of Beylerbey, with its conical and pyramidal
roofs and its gray and yellow walls, wearing
the same strange, mysterious look that a convent of
princesses might have; and then Beylerbey village,
reflected in the water, with Mount Bûlgurlû rising
behind it; and all those other villages, with houses
grouped closely together or else scattered about at
the foot of little bright green hills, and so overgrown
with vegetation that it seems as though they would
sink out of sight altogether. Long garlands of
villas and little houses, and avenues of trees connect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
them, running along the bank or descending in zigzag
lines from the neighboring heights to the water’s
edge, through numberless flower and vegetable gardens,
and meadows laid out in squares, connected by
little flights of stone steps and bright with every
conceivable shade of green.</p>

<div id="if_i_22" class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;">
  <img src="images/i_274.jpg" width="511" height="600" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Mosque of Validêh at Ak Serai.</div></div>

<p>Well, there is no help for it; we must resign ourselves
to catching nothing more than a flying glimpse
of it all, and can only get that by turning our heads
from side to side with the monotonous regularity of
automatons.</p>

<p>After leaving Cheragan behind, we see on our left
the large village of Orta, above which appears the
shining dome of the mosque erected by the Validéh
Sultan, mother of Abdul-Aziz, and the graceful roofs
of the palace of Riza-Pasha at the foot of a hill
from whose summit the light and shining walls of
the imperial kiosk of the Star peep out from amid a
dense mass of foliage. Orta Keui contains the residences
of a number of Greek, Armenian, and
Frankish bankers, and as we passed, the Constantinople
boat was in the act of landing her passengers.
A crowd of persons went ashore, other crowds stood
waiting to embark; there were Turkish and Armenian
gentlemen, officers, monks, eunuchs, dandies,
fezzes, turbans, hats like bushel-measures, little
caps, all jumbled together&mdash;a scene similar to that
which may be witnessed at any one of the twenty
boat-landings along the Bosphorus, more especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
toward evening. Opposite Orta Keui is the gay
little village of Chengel&mdash;village of the <i>anchor</i>; from
an old iron anchor found on its shore by Muhammad
II.<a id="FNanchor_L" href="#Footnote_L" class="fnanchor">L</a> It is surrounded by villas, while on the shore
stands that imperial kiosk of infamous celebrity
from which Murad IV., transported with envious
rage, ordered the execution of those groups of
country-people whom he saw passing happily through
the fields singing as they went.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_L" href="#FNanchor_L" class="fnanchor">L</a> Chengel Keui takes its name from the bend in the shore at
that point.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>Turning again toward the shore of Europe, we
find ourselves on a line with the pretty village and
charming harbor of Kuru Chesmeh, the ancient
Anaplus.<a id="FNanchor_M" href="#Footnote_M" class="fnanchor">M</a> Here Medea landed with Jason and
planted the famous laurel tree. Then, looking back
again to Asia, we see the smiling villages of Kulehli
and Vani spread out along the shore to right and left
of a huge barrack whose reflection in the water resembles
more that of a royal palace. Back of the
two villages rises a hill whose summit is crowned by
a large garden, in the midst of which, barely discernible
among the branches of the trees, glimmers
the white kiosk where Suleiman the Great passed
three years of his life, hidden away in a little tower,
to escape the spies and executioners of his father,
Selim. While we are trying to identify the tower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
amid the trees the steamer has passed Arnaût-Keui&mdash;the
Albanian village&mdash;now peopled by Greeks,
whose houses surround a small bay in the European
shore full of sailing vessels. But there is no use in
attempting to see everything. One village draws
away our attention from another; a beautiful mosque
distracts us from an exquisite landscape; and while
we are gazing at villages and harbors we have missed
palaces of viziers, pashâs, sultans, chief eunuchs, and
other prominent persons; yellow, blue, and purple
houses hung with vines and creepers, seeming to
float upon the top of the waves or overflow with
bloom, half buried in groves of cypress, laurel, and
orange trees; buildings with Corinthian façades ornamented
with rows of white marble columns; Swiss
châlets, Japanese huts, little Moorish palaces, Turkish
kiosks, whose three stories project one beyond
the other, the grated galleries of their harems overhanging
the Bosphorus, while little flights of stairs
lead down to gardens washed by the waves. All
the buildings are small, light, unsubstantial, corresponding
precisely to the nature of the power
wielded by those who inhabit them&mdash;the triumph
of youth, the success of an intrigue, a high office
which may be forfeited to-morrow, a glory doomed
to end in exile, a fortune destined to evaporate, a
greatness which will crumble away. There is
hardly an unoccupied spot on the Bosphorus: it is
like a sort of Grand Canal running through a huge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
rural Venice. Villas, kiosks, and palaces rise one
behind the other, so placed as to leave the façade
of each in view, those in the rear seeming to perch
upon the roofs of those in front, while between and
behind them is a mass of green, the tops and points
of oaks, plane trees, maples, poplars, pines, and fig
trees, through whose branches may be seen sparkling
fountains and the gleaming domes of lonely
türbehs and solitary mosques.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_M" href="#FNanchor_M" class="fnanchor">M</a> Arnaût-Keui, the next village, is the Anaplus of the ancients.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Trans.</span></p></div>

<p>Looking back at Constantinople, we can still make
out, indistinctly, the Seraglio Hill and the huge dome
of St. Sophia rising darkly against the gold and
limpid background of the evening sky; meanwhile,
Arnaût-Keui, Vani, Kulehli, Chengel, Orta have all
disappeared, and our surroundings undergone an
entire change. We now seem to be on an immense
lake; to right and left on either shore there opens
a little bay; around that on our left lies in a semicircle
the pretty Greek town of Bebek shaded by lofty
trees, among which stand a fine old mosque and the
imperial kiosk of Humayun-Habad, where in former
days the sultans used to grant secret audiences to
foreign ambassadors; on one side the town is buried
in the thick foliage of a little valley, on the other
it climbs the steep ascent of a hill covered with oak
trees and crowned by a grove famous for its echo,
where the noise of a single horse’s hoofs resounds
like the tramp of a regiment. The view here would
throw a queen into raptures, and yet it is straight-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>way
forgotten when we turn to look at the opposite
shore. There, indeed, it is a veritable earthly paradise
which is spread out before our eyes. Kandili,
variegated as a town of Holland, with its white
mosque and train of villas, describes a wide arc
upon a bold promontory; behind it rises the flowery
hill of Igiadié, crowned by a battlemented tower
where a watchman is stationed to keep a lookout for
any appearance of fire on either shore. Two valleys
open on the bay to the right of Kandili, and quite
close together, called respectively Big and Little <i>Blue
River</i>, and between them are the charming grounds
of the Sweet Waters of Asia, planted with sycamore,
oak, and plane trees, above which stands the magnificent
kiosk erected by the mother of Abdul-Mejid
in the style of the Dolmabâghcheh palace, surrounded
by its gardens all red with roses. Beyond
the “Large Blue River” may be seen the brilliant
colors of Anadoli Hissar, built upon the side of a
hill upon whose summit rise the graceful towers of
the Bayezid Ilderim, which exactly faces the castle
of Muhammad II. on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>At that hour this enchanting part of the Bosphorus
is full of life and movement; hundreds of little boats
cover the bays and inlets of the European shore;
steamers and sailing vessels pass, bound for the
harbor of Bebek; Turkish fishermen busy themselves
with their nets suspended over the water from
lofty poles and cross-beams; a throng of passengers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
disembark from the Constantinople boat upon the
stairs of the European town&mdash;Greek gentlemen,
Lazarists, students from the American Protestant
college, and family parties laden with shawls and
wraps. On the other side we can see with the aid
of the glass parties of Mussulman ladies walking
about beneath the trees of the Sweet Waters or
seated in little groups on the banks of the “Blue
Water,” while numberless käiks and small boats
with awnings, filled with Turkish men or women,
come and go along the shore. It is all so festive, so
Arcadian, so irresistibly charming, that I feel as
though I must fling myself overboard, and, swimming
to one or the other of the two banks, plant
myself there with the fixed determination, come
what may, to live and die in the midst of that
Mussulman paradise. All at once, with a new
change of scene, such ideas take flight: the Bosphorus
now stretches away directly ahead of us,
with something of the look of the Rhine, only it is
a modified, softened Rhine, decked with the gorgeous
and varied coloring of the Orient. On the left a
cemetery shaded by groves of cypresses and pines
forms the first break in the hitherto uninterrupted
chain of villages, and immediately after it, on the
rocky sides of Mount Hermæon, rise the three large
towers of Rumili Hissar, the Castle of Europe,
surrounded by battlemented walls and lesser towers,
covering the incline to the water’s edge with picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
ruins. This is the renowned fortress
erected by Muhammad II. a year before the conquest
of Constantinople in defiance of the indignant
remonstrances of Constantine, whose envoys, as
every one knows, were sent back threatened with
death by way of reply. This is the narrowest part
of the Bosphorus, it being here only eight hundred
and ten yards wide, and the current is consequently
so swift that it has obtained the name of the “Great
Current” from the Greeks and the “Devil’s
Current” from the Turks. It was here that Mandrokles
of Samos constructed the bridge of boats
across which Darius conducted his seven hundred
thousand soldiers, and, as it is supposed, that the
“Ten Thousand” crossed on their return from Asia;
but no trace can now be found either of the two
pillars of Mandrokles nor of the rock-hewn throne
of Mount Hermæon from whence the Persian king
watched the passage of his army. A little Turkish
village nestles at the foot of the castle, and the
Asiatic shore stretches away in the distance, ever
greener and more picturesque. There is an unbroken
succession of boat-landings, little houses,
gardens, tiny valleys overflowing with vegetation,
small inlets across which the limbs of the gigantic
trees which line their banks nearly meet, while
beneath white-sailed fishing-boats pass slowly along
on the placid surface of the water, and charming
pleasure-grounds, gay with flowers, shelve gently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
down to the shore, or terraced gardens framed in
verdure, while from the summits of the neighboring
hills gleam the white stones of little cemeteries.</p>

<div id="if_i_23" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_280.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Sweet Waters of Europe.</div></div>

<p>Next Kaneijeh comes unexpectedly into view, its
red houses covering two rocky promontories on the
Asiatic shore, against whose bases the waves break
with a musical sound, while above, the minarets of
its two charming mosques glisten among a dark mass
of cypress trees and umbrella pines. Along here
the gardens rise one above the other like terraces,
and the villas recommence, among the latter being
the marvellously beautiful palace of the celebrated
Fuad Pâsha, poet and diplomat, vain, voluptuous, and
charming, who has been called the Ottoman Lamartine.
A little farther on we come to the pretty
village of Balta Limân, situated at the opening of
a small valley on the European shore, through which
a narrow stream flows, emptying itself into the
harbor. Above rises a hill whose sides are covered
with villas, conspicuous among which is the ancient
palace of Reshid Pâsha. Then comes the bay of
Emir Ghian Oghlu Bagche, whose waters look green
from the surrounding cypress trees, among which
gleams, white as snow, a solitary mosque surmounted
by a great globe with golden rays. The boat meanwhile
approaches first one shore and then the other,
close enough for us to distinguish clearly all the
little details of the landscape. Now it is the vestibule
of the <i>selamlik</i> of a wealthy Turk, opening on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the water, in front of which a big majordomo is
stretched upon a divan smoking; then a eunuch who
stands upon the lowest step of a landing-stair assisting
two veiled Turkish ladies into a käik; farther
on an old Turk is seated cross-legged, meditating
upon the Koran, at the foot of an immense plane
tree, which shades a garden enclosed between green
hedges; family parties are assembled upon the
terraces of their country-houses; herds of sheep
and goats feed upon high pasture-lands; horsemen
gallop along the shore, and strings of camels pass
across the brows of the hills, their strange, unfamiliar
shapes outlined against the clear sky.</p>

<p>All at once the Bosphorus widens out, and the
aspect of everything changes anew. Again we are
between two bays, in the centre of a large lake:
that on the left is narrow and deep, and around it
lies the little Greek city of Stenia, formerly called
Sosthenius from the temple and winged statue placed
there by the Argonauts in honor of their tutelary
genius, who had awarded them the victory in their
encounter with Amycus, king of Bebryces. Thanks
to the inward course of the steamer at this point, we
are able to distinguish quite clearly the cafés and
small, closely-built houses along the shore, the villas
scattered about among their vineyards and olive
trees, the valley opening up from the harbor, the
cascade which falls from a neighboring height, and
the celebrated Moorish fountain of pure white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
marble, shaded by a group of huge maple trees,
from whose branches fish-nets are suspended above
the groups of Greek women who pass back and
forth carrying amphora upon their heads. Opposite
Stenia, on the bay in the Asiatic coast, is the Turkish
village of Chibûkli, where the famous Monastery
of the Sleepless once stood, whence prayer and
praise ascended to Heaven without interruption day
and night. Both shores of the Bosphorus from one
sea to the other teem with associations connected
with those fanatical monks and anchorites of the
fifth century, who wandered over the hills and
valleys laden with crosses and chains, wore hair-cloth
and iron collars, and remained immovable for
weeks and months at a time in the branches of a
tree or upon the summit of a column, while princes,
magistrates, soldiers, and churchmen prostrated themselves
at their feet, fasting, praying, beating their
breasts, imploring advice or a blessing as though
seeking a favor from God.</p>

<p>The Bosphorus has, however, one striking characteristic,
that of drawing away the thoughts of the
traveller who passes through it for the first time,
from the past to the present. All the associations,
dreams, fancies, memories awakened by familiarity
with its history or legends are put to flight, driven
back by the extraordinary richness of the vegetation,
the pomp of color, exuberance of life, and
magnificent abandonment of nature, in which everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
appears as though it were wreathed in smiles
and decked for a fête. It is even difficult to realize
that these same waters, these enchanting scenes,
were the witnesses of those furious sea-battles when
Bulgarians and Goths, Byzantines, Russians, and
Turks fell upon one another, fought, bled, and were
vanquished or overcame in turn; the very fortresses
which frown from the heights fail to awaken a
spark of that romantic horror which such ruins
always inspire when seen at other places; they
seem more like artificial adjuncts to the landscape
than the stern and actual records of a past which
has seen them vomit fire and death. Over all there
hangs a veil of languor and quiescence which suggests
no thoughts other than dreams of idleness and
an immense longing for peace.</p>

<p>Beyond Stenia the Bosphorus becomes still wider,
and in a few moments we are greeted with the finest
of any of the views we have had up to this time.
Looking toward Europe, we see directly before us
the little Greek and Armenian city of Yeni, built
upon the side of a hill covered with vineyards and
groves of pine trees, and extending around in the
shape of a bow above a rocky shore against which
the current sweeps with great violence; a little
beyond is the beautiful bay of Kalender, crowded
with boats, surrounded by small houses with
gardens; and garlanded with luxuriant vegetation,
while overhanging it are the aërial terraces of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
imperial kiosk. Turning to the other shore, we
find it curving in a large semicircle, above which
rises a hill, and in the natural amphitheatre thus
formed are a number of villages and harbors:
Injir Keui&mdash;the Fig village&mdash;set in a circle of
gardens; Sultanieh, half hidden in a forest; and the
large village of Beikos, surrounded by kitchen-gardens
and vineyards and shaded by tall walnut
trees, whose buildings are reflected in the waters
of the most beautiful gulf in the whole Bosphorus,
the very spot on which the king of Bebryces was
defeated by Pollux, and where the enchanted laurel
tree stood whose branches caused all who touched
them to become insane. Some distance beyond
Beikos may be seen Yali, the ancient village of
Amea, looking like a bunch of red and yellow
flowers thrown down on a great green carpet. All
of this, however, is but the merest sketch of that
wonderful picture; to which must be added the indescribably
soft lines of those lovely hills, looking as
though made to stroke with the hand; the innumerable
little nameless villages, which seem to have
been thrown in here and there as the artist had need
of them; that vegetation belonging to every climate;
that architecture representing every land; those
terraced gardens and cascades of water; the dark
shadows, shining mosques, deep blue sea dotted
with white sails, and over all that sky flushed by
the setting sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
At this point, however, I was seized with that sensation
of weariness and satiety which at some part or
other of the Bosphorus is pretty sure to attack the
traveller. The endless succession of soft lines and
brilliant colors becomes tiresome, the very monotony
of its beauty dulling one’s sense of enjoyment. You
feel at last that it would be a relief to come upon
some huge, rugged, misshapen mass of rock sticking
out from the land, or even a long desert strip of
coast, wild, desolate, strewn with the fragments of
a wreck. There is nothing to do, then, but turn
your attention to the water. The Bosphorus is like
an enormous port: we pass close beneath the shining
guns of the Ottoman men-of-war, through fleets
of merchantmen from every country in the world,
with sails of all colors, queerly-shaped bows, and
crowds of foreign-looking men upon their decks;
we meet and pass outlandish craft from the Asiatic
ports of the Black Sea; beautiful little sloops belonging
to the various embassies; gentlemen’s yachts
shoot by like arrows from the bow, taking part in
races which are witnessed from the shore by crowds
of spectators; rowboats of every pattern, filled with
persons of all colors, push off from the shore or draw
up at the thousand landing-stairs of the two continents;
käiks dart in and out among long lines of
barges, heavily laden with merchandise, towing
slowly up the stream; navy-launches flying flags
from their sterns; fishermen’s rafts; gilded käiks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
belonging to wealthy pashas; and steamboats from
Constantinople filled with turbans, fezzes, and veils,
which zigzag back and forth from one continent to
the other in order to touch at every landing. All
these sights seem to revolve around us as the steamer
pursues its winding course; the promontories shift
their positions; the hills unexpectedly change their
outlines; villages glide out of sight, to suddenly reappear
with an entirely new aspect; and both in
front and back of us the Bosphorus keeps altering
its character: now it is shut in like a big lake; now
it opens out into a long chain of smaller lakes, with
hills in the distance; then suddenly the hills close in
again before and behind, and we are encircled by a
green basin from which there is no apparent outlet,
but before there is time to exchange more than half
a dozen words with a neighbor the basin has disappeared
in its turn, and once again we find ourselves
surrounded by new heights, new towns, new harbors.</p>

<p>We are now between the two bays of Therapia&mdash;formerly
Pharmakia, from Medea’s poisons&mdash;and
Hunkiar Iskelesi, or Landing-place of the Sultan,
where the famous treaty of 1833 was signed which
closed the Dardanelles to foreign fleets. At this spot
the spectacle of the Bosphorus reaches the penultimate
stage of its beauty. Therapia is the finest of the towns
which grace its banks, after Buyukdereh, while the
valley which extends behind Hunkiar Iskelesi is the
greenest, most charming and romantic valley to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
found from the Sea of Marmora to the Black Sea.
Therapia is built partly upon a level strip of shore
at the foot of a large hill, and partly around a deep
bay, which forms its harbor and is filled with small
boats and shipping. Back of it opens the narrow
valley of Krio-nero, where more of the town is
squeezed in between the green sides of the hills.
The shore is dotted with picturesque-looking cafés
extending out over the water, handsome hotels, gay
little houses, and groups of lofty trees which shade
open squares and marble fountains; back of these
are the summer residences of the French, Italian,
and English ambassadors, and beyond these, again,
stands an imperial kiosk. All up the hillsides are
terrace upon terrace, garden upon garden, villa upon
villa, grove upon grove; people dressed in vivid
colors crowd in and out of the cafés, stream over the
harbor and shore and up the paths leading to the
tops of the hills, just as though some great fête were
in progress. The Asiatic shore, on the contrary, is
tranquillity itself. The little village of Hunkiar
Iskelesi, a favorite place of residence among the
wealthy Armenians of Constantinople, sleeps quietly
among its plane and cypress trees and about its diminutive
harbor, on the bosom of whose waters a
few boats may be seen gliding peacefully along.
High above the village, upon the summit of a vast
incline of terraced gardens, towers the solitary and
magnificent kiosk of Abdul-Aziz, beyond which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
again, extends the favorite valley of the pâdishahs half
hidden under dense masses of tropical vegetation and
surrounded by a dreamy mystery.</p>

<p>All of this marvellous beauty, however, fades into
nothing a mile farther on, when, the steamer having
arrived off the Bay of Buyukdereh, we are confronted
by the crowning, the supreme glory of the
Bosphorus. Here he who has become weary of its
beauty, and possibly allowed himself to give utterance
to some irreverent criticism, is forced to bow
his head and humbly beg for pardon. We are in
the centre of a large lake, so surrounded and
hemmed in by marvels of every description that
there seems nothing for it but to begin spinning
around in the bow, like dervishes, so as to see all
the shore and all the hills at once.</p>

<p>On the European side, extending around a deep
bay where the swift current dies away in gentle little
waves, and below a large hill whose sides are dotted
with innumerable villas, lies the town of Buyukdereh,
large, colored like a huge bed of flowers, and entirely
composed of small palaces, kiosks, and villas
planted in the midst of a mass of vegetation of the
most vivid green imaginable, which seems to pour
out over the roofs and walls and overflow into the
streets and squares. To the right the town extends
as far as an inlet like a smaller bay in the large one,
surrounded by the village of Kefeli; behind this a
wide valley opens, green with meadows and sprinkled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
with white houses, following which one can reach
the aqueduct of Mahmûd and the forest of Belgrâd.
Tradition says that the armies of the first
Crusaders encamped in this valley in 1096, and one
of the seven gigantic plane trees for which the spot
is famous is called the plane tree of Godfrey de
Bouillon. Beyond Kefeli Keni is still another small
bay, colored with white and green reflections from
the neighboring houses and trees, and beyond this,
again, Therapia is visible scattered along the base
of her dark-green hills.</p>

<p>Having allowed our gaze to wander thus far, we
turn once more toward Asia, and find with astonishment
that we are opposite the loftiest hill on the
Bosphorus, the Giant’s Mountain, shaped like a huge
green pyramid, on whose summit is the celebrated
grave to which three separate legends have given
the names, respectively, of “The Couch of Hercules,”
“The Grave of Amycus,” and “The Tomb
of Joshua.” It is now guarded by a couple of dervishes
and visited by sick Mussulmans, who carry
thither the rags of their clothing according to a
practice in vogue among them. The forest-clad and
vine-decked sides of the mountain extend to the
very water’s edge, where, between two bright green
promontories, lies the pretty bay of Umur Yeri, all
streaked with the hundred different colored reflections
of a Mussulman village on its shore, from
which strings of villas and houses extend like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
wings across the adjoining fields or like masses of
flowers thrown about at random. But the entire
view is not confined to this body of water: directly
ahead of us glimmers the Black Sea, and looking
back toward Constantinople, we behold on the
other side of Therapia, in the dim purple distance,
the bay of Kalender, Yeni Keui, Injir Keui, and
Sultanieh, looking far more like imaginary scenes
from some dream-world than actual towns and villages.</p>

<p>The sun is setting: a delicate veil of pale blue
and gray begins to fall over the European shore, but
Asia is still bathed in golden light; across the
sparkling water numbers of boats filled with married
couples and lovers, excursionists from Constantinople,
press toward the European shore, meet and
stop one another, and overtake others filled with
parents and children from the neighboring villas.
Bursts of music and song come from the cafés of
Buyukdereh; eagles circle above the summit of
Giant’s Mountain, the white lights on the shore fly
by, kingfishers gleam through the water, dolphins
swim about the ship, the fresh wind of the Black
Sea blows in our faces. Where are we? whither
are we bound? It is a moment of rapture, of intoxication,
in which the sights of the past two hours,
both shores of the Bosphorus, all that we have felt
and seen, melt and blend together in one glowing,
rapturous vision of a single vast city ten times the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
size of Constantinople, peopled by all the nations of
the earth, visited by every blessing from the Almighty,
and given over to an endless series of feastings
and merrymakings, the contemplation of which
fills one with despairing envy.</p>

<div id="if_i_24" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_292.jpg" width="600" height="426" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Entrance to the Black Sea.</div></div>

<p>This is our last vision. The steamer issuing
rapidly from the bay of Buyukdereh, we see on our
right a small inlet formed by the ancient promontory
of Simas, upon which rose the temple of Venus
Meretricia, for whom Greek sailors had an especial
veneration; then comes the village of Yeni Mahalleh;
then the fort of Deli Tabia, facing another
small fort which is stationed on the opposite shore at
the foot of Giant’s Mountain; next is the castle of
Rumili Kavak, whose rugged outlines are clearly defined
against the rosy sky tinged by the setting sun.
Opposite Rumili Kavak stands another fort, crowning
the point upon which rose the temple of the Twelve
Gods erected by the Argive Phrygos near to one
dedicated to Jupiter, the “distributor of favorable
winds,” by the Chalcedons, and converted by Justinian
into the church of Michael the Archangel.
Here the Bosphorus narrows in for the last time between
the outer spur of the Bithynian mountains and
the extreme point of the Hemus chain. This was
always considered the first place of importance in
the strait to be defended from the north, and consequently
has been the scene of many hard-fought
battles between Byzantine and barbarian, Venetian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and Genoese fleets. Two ruined towers can be made
out indistinctly marking the sites of the Genoese
castles, which faced each other here, and between
which an iron chain was stretched to stop the passage
of unfriendly fleets. From this point the Bosphorus
widens out to the sea, the banks grow high and steep
like two huge ramparts, bare apparently, save for
occasional groups of poor-looking houses, a solitary
tower or two, the ruins of a monastery, or remains
of some ancient mole. After proceeding for some
distance we again see the gleaming lights of a village,
Beuyük Limân, and opposite it others shine
from the fort which stands upon the promontory of
the Elephant. On our left is the great mass of rock
called by the ancients Gypopolis, upon which rose
the palace of Phineas infested by the Harpies, and
on the right Poiras Point shows dim and indistinct
against the gray sky. The two shores are now far
apart, and the strait seems more like a wide gulf.
Night is falling, and the sea-breeze whistles through
the rigging, while the broad surface of the melancholy
<i>Mare Cimmerium</i> stretches away before us
gray and restless; and still we are unable to detach
our minds from those wonderful scenes through
which we have just passed, so crowded with romantic
and historical associations, especially now,
when our senses are no longer overpowered by the
sight of their natural beauties. In fancy we explore
that left shore as far as the foot of the Little Balkans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
search for Ovid’s tower of exile and the marvellous
Anastasian Wall; then, crossing to Asia, wander
over a vast volcanic tract of land, through forests
infested by wild boars and jackals, amid the huts of
a savage and cruel people, whose sinister shadows
we seem to see as they congregate upon the precipitous
bank invoking disaster for us on the <i>fera litora
Ponti</i>. The darkness is broken for the last time by
two flaming points looking like the fiery eyes of two
Cyclops set to guard the approach to that enchanted
strait; they are Anadoli Fanar, the lighthouse on the
Asiatic side, and Rumili Fanar, at whose feet the
rugged profile of the Symplegades can be dimly discerned
in the shadow of the banks. Then the coasts
of Asia and Europe are merely two black lines, and
then, <i>Quocumque adspicias nihil est nisi Pontus et
aer</i>, as poor Ovid sang.</p>

<p>But I see her still, my beloved Constantinople,
beyond those two fading shores. I see her larger
and more radiant than she ever appeared when I
gazed upon her from the Validéh Sultan bridge or
from the heights of Skutari, and I talk with and salute
and adore her as the last and fondest dream of a
youth which is passing away. But a dash of salt
water, striking me full in the face and knocking off
my hat, rouses me abruptly from my dreams. I look
around: the bow is deserted, the sky obscured, a raw
autumnal wind chills me to the bone; poor Yunk,
attacked by sea-sickness, has withdrawn; nothing is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
heard but the rattle of the ship’s lanterns and creaking
of the vessel as she flies along, rocked and
beaten by the waves, into the darkness of the night.
My beautiful Oriental dream is ended.</p>

display the text and whether or not Project Gutenberg, where both of
these volumes reside, accepts such links.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
